title: IP400 Network Project
excerpt: The long term goal of the project is to implement a network that is capable of carrying digital voice and video, as well as catering to other services such as telemetry, messaging and more. At the home station a simple node based on a Raspberry Pi will get you onto the network, and at repeater sites a more complex controller will not only control analog and C4FM radios, but also include an IP400 transceiver for networking.
