Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is [testing the impacts](https://www.radioworld.com/global/japanese-am-stations-begin-suspensions) of shutting down AM radio stations. For a year-long period beginning this past February, 34 AM radio stations in Japan will shut down for at least a subset of that period. Stations are encouraged to relay programming via other channels such as FM, television, and internet.

The experiment is designed to measure the impact of AM radio going away. Comments from the public are being collected during the period.
