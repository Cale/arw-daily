[Recently published public records](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/bdd10bdd-4af6-4289-b4f0-08b468c0ce65.html) revealed that ARRL was a victim of a [ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/arrl-finally-confirms-ransomware-gang-stole-data-in-cyberattack/) that ultimately resulted in services such as Log Book of The World being offline for several weeks.

While data belonging to ARRL members and users of ARRL services wasn't directly affected by the attack, public records revealed that up to 150 ARRL employees did have personal data compromised.

At this stage there is no evidence that compromised data was misused. It's unknown whether ARRL paid a ransom as part of the attack.
