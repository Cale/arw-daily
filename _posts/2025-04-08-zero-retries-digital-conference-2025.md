*The following is an announcement from Zero Retries:*

We are pleased to announce that the inaugural Zero Retries Digital Conference will be held in **Everett, Washington, USA** on **Saturday, September 13, 2025**. The Zero Retries Digital Conferences (ZRDCs) are sponsored by the [Zero Retries newsletter](https://www.zeroretries.org/).

The presentations at ZRDC will showcase technological innovation in Amateur Radio such as are typically discussed in the Zero Retries newsletter. Some very exciting presentations, demonstrations, and new technology will be discussed and revealed at ZRDC 2025. Topics include (but are not limited to):

- The IP400 Networking Project
- M17 Digital Voice / Data system (including demonstrations with an M17 repeater)
- MMDVM-TNC data system (including demonstration of MMDVM-TNC via repeater)
- AREDN, HamWAN, and other Amateur Radio microwave networking

Zero Retries Digital Conference 2025 builds on the rich history of significant Amateur Radio conferences in the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area that also showcased technological innovation in Amateur Radio, including [Comm Academy](https://www.commacademy.org/), [MicroHAMS Digital Conference](https://www.mhdc.live/), [Valley Camp Summer Gathering](https://wa7vc.org/summergathering), and the 1996 and [2013](https://tapr.org/32nd-arrl-and-tapr-digital-communications-conference/) TAPR Digital Communications Conferences (both of which are the first and second best attended DCCs).

ZRDC 2025 will be held in the same venue as the [GNU Radio Conference 2025](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/26/) - the [Edward D. Hansen Conference Center](https://www.angelofthewindsarena.com/conference-center) in downtown Everett. GRCon 2025 will be held Monday September 8th through Friday, September 12th, 2025.

While GRCon 2025 and ZRDC 2025 are being held consecutively, and at the same venue, the two events are independent of each other.

The manager of the Zero Retries Digital Conference is Tina Stroh KD7WSF.

Calls for, and direct invitations for ZRDC 2025 Presentations will go out soon with a signup sheet. Sponsorship queries should be directed to Tina.

Ticket sales for ZRDC will be available at a later date. The venue of ZRDC will accommodate a large number of attendees so ticket sales will not be capped.
