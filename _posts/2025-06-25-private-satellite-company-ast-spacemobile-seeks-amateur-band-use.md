The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US has received a [request from AST SpaceMobile](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-532A1.pdf) to modify an existing license that would allow it to transmit within the amateur radio 70 cm band. Specifically, the company seeks the use of the 430-440 MHz spectrum to perform telemetry, tracking, and telecommand between ground stations and a constellation of 243 satellites in low-earth, non-geostationary orbit.

Based on activity within the [AMSAT-DL forums](https://forum.amsat-dl.org/index.php?thread/4203-ast-spacemobile-constellation-in-430-440-mhz-band/&pageNo=1), it's been suggested that AST SpaceMobile has interfered with the 70 cm amateur bands in the past. [Communications Daily reported](https://communicationsdaily.com/article/2023/01/12/germany-requiring-ast-satellite-shutoff-2301110032) in 2023 that Germany required AST SpaceMobile to shut off operations when in radio range of the country. The government cited non-compliance with ITU regulations.

[AST SpaceMobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AST_SpaceMobile) is building a satellite constellation based cellular network that can utilize existing smart phones. The company is based in Midland, Texas, US and is publicly traded.
