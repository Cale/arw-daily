[Amateur Radio on the International Space Station](https://ariss-usa.org/message-to-us-educators-amateur-radio-on-the-international-space-station-contact-opportunity-7/) (ARISS) is requesting educational organizations to submit proposals to conduct amateur radio contacts with astronauts on the International Space Station. 

> Crew scheduling and ISS orbits will determine the exact contact dates. To maximize these radio contact opportunities, ARISS is looking for organizations that will draw large numbers of participants and integrate the contact into a well-developed education plan.

Proposals may be [submitted](http://www.ariss.org/) between July 8th and September 6th. Additional information and proposal guidelines will be presented during an ARISS webinar on July 22 at 7:00 PM Eastern. Webinar registration may be completed [here](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZErf-ihrDktG9OphYxAjfz7nbONV0YcwY55).
