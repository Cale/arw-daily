From HamCation PR:

> From February 9 to 11, 2024, the Orlando Amateur Radio Club hosted the 77th annual Orlando HamCation at the Central Florida Fairgrounds and Expo Park in Orlandoâ€”an 87-acre lakefront fairground. HamCation enjoyed splendid weather throughout the weekend, with temperatures hovering around the mid-seventies and no rainfall. This year's attendance reached a record high of 25,321, making 2024 the largest attendance in HamCation history.

> We would like to express our gratitude to all the visitors and vendors for their participation in this fantastic show.
