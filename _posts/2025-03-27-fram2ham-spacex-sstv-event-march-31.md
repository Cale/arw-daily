Scheduled to launch on Monday March 31st, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry the [Fram2 mission](https://f2.com/) to space. Comprised of four astronauts, the mission is designed to take a polar orbit around Earth for a 3-5 day period. During that time, astronaut and amateur radio operator Rabea Rogge (LB9NJ/KD3AID) will be [transmitting SSTV images](https://fram2ham.com/) from the Dragon spacecraft between 435 and 438 MHz. (A simulation conducted from the International Space Station in February occurred on 437.550 MHz utilizing mode PD-120.)

> Fram2Ham is an experimental radio competition open to high school and university ages. Rogge will send pictures of three geographical locations via an onboard ham radio, but here’s the twist: they’ll be cut into pieces and mixed up! Participants will receive only fragments of the locations and need to guess where on Earth they are and what their role in polar history was.
