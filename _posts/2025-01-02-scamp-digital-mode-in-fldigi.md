Simple Conversational Amateur Message Protocol (SCAMP) is a weak signal digital mode developed by Dr. Daniel Marks (KW4TI). Originally integrated with the [RFBitBanger transceiver](https://github.com/profdc9/RFBitBanger), SCAMP is now available for broader use through the [Fldigi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fldigi/) software suite. 

> Like other weak signal propagation modes such as the popular FT8, SCAMP is an orthogonal frequency shift keying mode with a low symbol rate, forward error correction, and synchronous signaling. Unlike FT8 which has been designed to exchange signal reports, SCAMP must be able to communicate arbitrary messages that may be required in an emergency situation. [1]
