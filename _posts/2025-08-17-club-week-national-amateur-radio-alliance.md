This fall, the [National Amateur Radio Alliance](https://amateurradioalliance.org/) (NARA) will sponsor [Club Week](https://amateurradioalliance.org/club-week.php), a special event for clubs to make contact with one another on the air. 

> Unlike a contest, Club Week does not involve earning points or submitting logs to NARA. Instead, itâ€™s a relaxed and engaging event where clubs can operate from a club shack, a member's home, a park, or any public location. Clubs are encouraged to organize additional activities to make the most of this opportunity. Participants should be prepared to send and respond to QSL cards, which provides additional opportunities to engage and teach new hams.

Club Week will span 9 days. While a final date hasn't yet been finalized, clubs can [register early](https://amateurradioalliance.org/club-week-registration.php) for the event on the NARA website.
