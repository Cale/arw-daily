[Zero Retries reports](https://www.zeroretries.org/p/zero-retries-0181?open=false#%C2%A7m-foundation-established) the establishment of the [M17 Foundation](https://m17foundation.org/):

> Note that this new website is different, and differently administered, from the [https://m17project.org](https://m17project.org/) website which seems to be no longer maintained.

The foundation website is short on details, but the [initial announcement](https://m17foundation.org/2024/12/06/m17-foundation-established/) describes the M17 Foundation as serving as a method of legal protection for the M17 Project now that manufacturers have [recently begun implementing M17 into various devices](http://daily.hamweekly.com/2024/07/first-m17-radios-are-shipping/).

Zero Retries suggests this move should help consolidate communications, better facilitate the acceptance of grants, and consolidate the project's community of developers and users.

While no information has yet to be posted, the website suggests a forthcoming [M17 Conference](https://m17foundation.org/m17-conference-2025/) in 2025, [sponsorship](https://m17foundation.org/sponsors/) opportunities, and an [M17 Award](https://m17foundation.org/m17-award/).
