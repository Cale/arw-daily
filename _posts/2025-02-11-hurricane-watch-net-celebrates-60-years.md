The [Hurricane Watch Net](https://hwn.org/) (HWN) is [celebrating 60 years of service](http://www.arrl.org/news/view/hurricane-watch-net-turning-60-seeking-net-control-operators) in 2025. With hurricane season expected to be more active than seasons of years past, HWC is seeking additional volunteers to serve as net control operators.

> Net Manager Bobby Graves, KB5HAV, reports HWN is preparing for what could be, yet again, an above-average hurricane season and that the net needs more amateur radio operators to help.

Amateur radio operators interested in applying for net control positions can learn more on the [HWN website](https://arrl.informz.net/z/cjUucD9taT0zMjQ5Mjg3JnA9MSZ1PTUyNTgxODI4NCZsaT0zNjgyMDQwNA/index.html).
