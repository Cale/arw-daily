The Annual Armed Forces Day Crossband Test is scheduled for May 10th, 2025. Organized by the Department of Defense (DOD), the event facilitates two-way communication between military stations and amateur radio operators. 

> ...authorized by the Federal Communications Commission in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations 47 CFR 97.111. The test provides opportunities, and challenges, for operators to test their individual technical skills in a controlled scenario that will not impact public or private communications.

The DOD message will be sent via RTTY on 14667.0 kHz at 1400 and 2000 UTC. For additional schedules and frequencies, see the [MARS](https://www.dodmars.org/mars-comex-information-website/armed-forces-day) website.
