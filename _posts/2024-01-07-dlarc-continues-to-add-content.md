Kay Savetz (K6KJN), posted an update in the [most recent issue of Zero Retries](https://www.zeroretries.org/p/zero-retries-0133#%C2%A7whats-new-at-digital-library-of-amateur-radio-and-communications-january) highlighting the continued stream of rich content and history being donated to the [Digital Library of Amateur Radio &amp; Communications](https://archive.org/details/dlarc) (DLARC).

> The real fun, in my opinion, comes with radio magazines, which add art, advertisements, and really show the fun of the radio hobby in 1928. Start with the [November 1928 edition of Science and Invention](https://archive.org/details/scienceinventionunse_2) (with an article about how an airplane transmitted a photograph via radio, and a bargain at just 25 cents cover price!) Then enjoy the [November 1928 edition of Radio Listeners' Guide and Callbook](https://archive.org/details/radiolistenersguunse) (the ads are amazing.) You can read [a whole year of Radio magazine](https://archive.org/search?query=identifier:sim_audio_1927-*), and [The General Radio Experimenter](https://archive.org/search?query=identifier:sim_general-radio-experimenter_1928*), and [Radio News](https://archive.org/search?query=identifier:sim_radio-television-news_1928*), and [QST](https://archive.org/search?query=identifier:sim_qst_1928*).

This latest round of additions to DLARC also [includes Amateur Radio Weekly](https://midnightcheese.com/2024/01/amateur-radio-weekly-internet-archive/), the weekly email [newsletter](https://hamweekly.com/) companion to this website!
