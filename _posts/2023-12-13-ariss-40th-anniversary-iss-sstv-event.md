[ARISS](https://www.ariss.org/) is planning a slow scan television (SSTV) event transmitting from the International Space Station (ISS). The event runs December 16-19 and will celebrate 40 years of amateur radio and human spaceflight. One of the earliest SSTV events from space occurred when Tony England (W0ORE) sent images from [STS-51F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-51-F).

SSTV images are transmitted from the ISS on 145.800 MHz using the PD120 format.
