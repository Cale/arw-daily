Based on [interviews conducted by KB6NU](https://www.kb6nu.com/is-this-good-business-or-boneheaded/), the [American Radio Relay League](http://www.arrl.org/) (ARRL) appears to be dropping support for amateur radio related organizations that produce content similar to content produced by ARRL. Two high-profile groups have been told by ARRL officials that they will no longer be promoted by the league as a result of the "competition" that these groups are creating with the [ARRL Learning Center](https://learn.arrl.org/).

This is a developing story. It's not yet clear if these are isolated incidents or a broader strong-arm strategy by ARRL to minimize competition with amateur radio related content producers.
