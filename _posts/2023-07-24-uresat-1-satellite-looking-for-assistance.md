The [URE](https://uresat.ure.es/) of Spain recently launched and deployed a pocketQube satellite into orbit and now they're seeking assistance from the community. While the satellite is operational and sending signals, the antennas have so far failed to deploy. The URE is requesting help from groups that can provide a powerful VHF station capable of transmitting a strong enough signal to overcome the weak receive state of the satellite. The goal is to transmit a request to once again attempt to deploy the satellite's antennas.

URESAT-1 is currently [transmitting telemetry, CW, and SSTV images](https://www.amsat-ea.org/) despite the reduced capability of the antenna system.
