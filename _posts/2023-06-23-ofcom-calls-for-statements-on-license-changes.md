[Ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/), the communications regulator for the United Kingdom, is [requesting feedback](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/consultations-and-statements/category-2/updating-amateur-radio-licensing-framework) to potential changes to the amateur radio licensing framework.

Just a few of the changes outlined in the 101 page proposal include:

- Only permit licensees to hold a single individual licence, requiring surrender of lower licences as they progress
- Streamline and modernise call sign assignment
- Increase the maximum permitted transmit power to allow 20 Watts for Foundation and 100
Watts for Intermediate licensees in most bands; and 1000 Watts for Full licensees in bands
where amateur radio has a primary allocation
- Permit the deployment of repeaters, beacons and gateways without requiring a NoV in most
cases
- Allow Foundation licensees to build their own equipment and access the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
bands
- Enable low power airborne use in some frequency bands

The [full proposal is available via PDF](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/263181/consultation-amateur-radio-review.pdf) on the Ofcom website.
