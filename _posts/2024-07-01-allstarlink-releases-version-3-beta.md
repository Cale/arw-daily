[AllStarLink](https://allstarlink.org/) has [announced](https://community.allstarlink.org/t/asl3-beta-announcement/21240?u=wd6awp) a major update to their software, AllStarLink 3 (ASL3). Now in beta, [ASL3](https://allstarlink.github.io/) upgrades the popular repeater and hotspot software from Asterisk version 1.4 to version 20, a 15 year leap in PBX phone system technology.

ASL3 is now capable of running on both X86_64 and arm64 hardware, physical and virtual. Additional improvements include:

- Runs as non-root user
- Supports Debian 12 and future updates
