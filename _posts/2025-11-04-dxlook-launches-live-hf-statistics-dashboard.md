*The following is a message from DXLook creator AK6FP:*

[DXLook.com](https://dxlook.com/), the live HF propagation map has released a new [Statistics Dashboard](https://dxlook.com/statistics) — giving amateur radio operators an easy way to see what’s happening on the bands in real time.

The dashboard gathers live data from WSPRnet, PSK Reporter, and the Reverse Beacon Network to show activity by callsign, country, band, and mode. Operators can quickly check:

- Which bands are most active right now
- The top 20 callsigns and grids heard worldwide
- Real-time source activity from each network
- Mode-specific trends for CW, SSB, and Digital

The page updates automatically every hour.

Each callsign in the dashboard links directly to DXLook’s real-time map, letting operators explore propagation paths and activity with a single click.

The Statistics Dashboard is free to use and available now at [https://dxlook.com/statistics](https://dxlook.com/statistics)
