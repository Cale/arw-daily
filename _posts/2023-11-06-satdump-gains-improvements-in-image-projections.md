[SatDump](https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/), a popular piece of software used to decode imagery from weather satellites such as NOAA-18 and others, has gained significant updates to the way it processes and projects received images on maps. Imagery projections are much more accurate as a result of recent code refactors. A detailed deep-dive into the changes have been [published](https://www.satdump.org/posts/projection-story/).

SatDump is available for all major platforms.
