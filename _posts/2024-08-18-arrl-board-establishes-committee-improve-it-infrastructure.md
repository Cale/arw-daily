During its July meeting, the ARRL Board of Directors approved the formation of the ARRL Information Technology Advisory Committee (ITAC). The committee is charged with overseeing the current ARRL information technology infrastructure as well as security of those systems. The board suggested the ARRL Investment Management Committee as a model for ITAC, referencing the desire to engage experts from the field to help oversee IT related tasks.

In the spirit of moving quickly, the ITAC is expected to have its initial meeting within 30 days of the July meeting and have a roadmap in place by January.
