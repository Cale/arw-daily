The [2024 Route 66 On The Air](https://w6jbt.org/?page_id=15) special event will be active September 7-15.

> This year marks the 25th year of this great radio event. Originally started by the Northern Arizona DX Association, it was a way to allow amateur radio operators a fun way to "Relive the Ride." They also can relive their own memories of Route 66, and get to celebrate the highwayâ€™s rich history in making the U.S. what it is today.
