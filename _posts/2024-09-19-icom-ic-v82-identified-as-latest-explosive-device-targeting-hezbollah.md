[Icom IC-V82](https://www.universal-radio.com/catalog/ht/0882.html) handheld transceivers designed for amateur radio use have been identified as the latest device to deliver deadly explosions targeting members of Hezbollah. The identification of [Icom radios](https://www.icomjapan.com/) follows an initial attack on members of Hezbollah in which pager devices were used to deliver deadly explosions.

[Icom is investigating](https://www.icomjapan.com/news/4202/) the reports of its radios being used in these attacks while Icom sales reps believe the radios identified are knock-offs. Icom is expected to release its findings on its website. The IC-V82 was discontinued in 2014.
