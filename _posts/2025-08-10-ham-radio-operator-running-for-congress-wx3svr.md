Austin Ayers (WX3SVR) is [running for US Congress](https://ayersforcongress.com/) with a campaign focusing on the rights of the amateur radio community. In an email sent to *Amateur Radio Daily*, WX3SVR described three bills he'd plan to introduce if he's elected: 

> **1. Amateur Radio Accessibility and Antenna Rights Act**   
If elected, I would introduce legislation to prevent HOA's, condominium boards, and other private entities from enforcing any such rules that could ban antennas from being installed. I would also prevent such boards and agencies from throwing requests for antennas into a bottomless pit, and guideline the maximum of 30 days to issue approval.

> **2. Amateur Radio Spectrum Protection and Expansion Act**   
If elected, I would introduce and sponsor a bill that would protect and expand the amateur radio spectrum. This would prevent our spectrum from being re-allocated to commercial users, and allow for bandwidth expansion to accommodate larger limits for modern digital modes.

> **3. Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Enhancement Act**   
If elected, the Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Enhancement Act would authorize registered non-profit clubs that provide emergency communications to get access to apply for grants through FEMA and DHS, while requiring FEMA and state EMA's to include trained and licensed amateur radio operators in their disaster response plans. I would also introduce a tax credit for licensed operators who purchase equipment that will be used for emergency communications. After seeing how vital amateur radio was during the response to Hurricane Helene, I do not know how WNC would be able to recover from a disaster like that. Ham radio saved lives!

> This nation is facing a major crisis in the political field, and that is the divide between the left and the right. At the end of the day, we need to love our neighbors and put this major fight to the side to get things done! I want to protect the rights of my constituents and every amateur radio operator in this great nation! One major key point I want to bring up is that I am running for a federal office, meaning I have direct input on the laws the FCC must follow. Not just a state representative or senator, but federal which will benefit every ham radio operator!
