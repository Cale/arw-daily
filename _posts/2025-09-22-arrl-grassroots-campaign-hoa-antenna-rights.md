[ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/) has launched a [campaign](https://www.arrl.org/news/view/arrl-launches-nationwide-grassroots-campaign-to-pass-amateur-radio-emergency-preparedness-act-1) to promote the passage of US legislation that would prevent antenna restrictions often imposed by homeowners' associations. 

> The bipartisan bills -- H.R.1094 in the House and S.459 in the Senate -- are designed to prevent restrictive homeownersâ€™ association (HOA) rules that currently prohibit or severely limit the installation of amateur radio antennas, even when such antennas are hidden in trees, placed in attics, mounted on vehicles, or look like flagpoles.

ARRL is asking all US based hams to take part in a letter writing campaign to their congressional representatives in both the House and Senate. [Tools are available](https://send-a-letter.org/hoa/) to assist with the campaign which includes pre-written letters.
