[ARISS](https://ariss-usa.org/) has relayed [plans](https://ariss-usa.org/sstv-shaping-up-for-july-event/) for an SSTV event to be conducted by the [AX-4 crew](https://www.nasa.gov/event/axiom-mission-4/) that recently arrived on the ISS.

> An ARISS SSTV event will begin no earlier than July 14 with the expectation that the event will run through the weekend into the beginning of the following week. This is all subject to AX-4 schedule and other operational considerations. The subject will be the 50th anniversary of the [ASTP](https://www.nasa.gov/apollo-soyuz-test-project/) and the 40th anniversary of [STS-51F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-51-F).  STS-51F was the second SAREX flight and had the first use of SSTV in human spaceflight.
