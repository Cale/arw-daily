> **Experience and history with amateur radio and the Internet is required.** Many of the people we work with, projects we take on, and communities we make grants to are rooted in amateur radio, and our particular realm of focus intersects heavily with the information technology and hacker communities. **Applicants without an active amateur radio license will not be considered.**

> **Experience working with nonprofits and/or open-source technology projects is required.** There are nuances of working in nonprofit and community-driven environments, including participation in open-source technology projects, that can only be learned through experience â€“ such as collaborative decision-making and best practices in engaging with open-source development. **Experience in one or both of these areas is required for this role; applicants without such experience will not be considered.**
