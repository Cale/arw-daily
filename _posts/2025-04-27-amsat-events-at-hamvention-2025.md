**AMSAT Dinner at Tickets – Thursday, May 15th**

> The annual AMSAT “Dinner at Tickets” party will be held at Tickets Pub & Eatery on Thursday, May 15th from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM EDT. There is no program or speaker – just good conversation. Everyone is invited... Come as you are; no reservations required.

**TAPR/AMSAT Banquet – Friday, May 16th**

> The 16th annual TAPR/AMSAT Banquet will be held at the Kohler Presidential Banquet Center on Friday, May 16th at 18:30 EDT. This dinner is always a highlight of the TAPR (Tucson Amateur Packet Radio) and AMSAT (Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.) activities during the Dayton Hamvention.  This year’s banquet speaker will be Phil Karn, KA9Q, who will highlight developments and use cases for his ka9q-radio software suite.

Tickets are $70 and may be [purchased](https://www.amsat.org/product/2025-tapr-amsat-friday-night-banquet-registration/) from AMSAT

**AMSAT Forum – Saturday, May 17th**

> The AMSAT Forum will take place in Forum Room 2 at 1:35pm – 3:10pm on Saturday, May 17th. This will immediately follow the ARISS Forum in the same room at 12:40pm, so get there early and see both presentations!
