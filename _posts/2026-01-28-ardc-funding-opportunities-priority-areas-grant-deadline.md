[ARDC](https://www.ardc.net/) continues to accept grant applications from organizations aiming to advance the hobby of amateur radio and beyond. The next application deadline is just around the corner on February 1st, but three additional rounds of applications will be accepted later this year on April 1st, July 1st, and September 1st.

> ARDC makes grants to programs and organizations that aim to advance our mission and vision, with the strategic goals of getting more people learning, experimenting, and doing with amateur radio and digital communications technology.

With the recent introduction of [Priority Areas for Funding](https://www.ardc.net/apply/priority-areas-for-funding/), ARDC is especially interested in projects that align with the following areas:

- **Research & Development (R&D):** open hardware and software systems that enable learning and experimentation (e.g. SDRs, open codec technologies, new modulation techniques).
- **Space-Based Communications:** projects that create or expand access to satellite communications for amateur radio (AR) and digital communications (DC), engaging communities in wireless experimentation (e.g. GEO or HEO programs, repurposed commercial satellites, space-based tools for learning).
- **Open Source Education:** scalable, open educational materials and hands-on projects that make AR and DC more accessible, especially for new learners and clubs (e.g. curricula, videos).

ARDC welcomes proposals across the full range of amateur radio and digital communications, but projects that align with these areas remain a priority. Learn more about [applying for grants](https://www.ardc.net/apply/) at ARDC.
