[The Online Amateur Radio Community](https://www.oarc.uk/) (OARC) is based out of the UK, but primarily embraces the online space to help build a global community around the amateur radio hobby. Twice a month, OARC meets at the virtual *Rubber Duck Pub* over Zoom for casual chat.

In addition, OARC hosts a [Discord server](https://www.oarc.uk/join), [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@onlineamateurradiocommunit1221), and [digital RF bridge](https://www.oarc.uk/digital-channels) via DMR, D-STAR, Echolink, AllStarLink and Fusion. OARC is also one of the largest license training organizations in the UK.
