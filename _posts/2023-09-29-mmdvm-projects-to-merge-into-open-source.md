From ARDC:

Funded by a grant from [Amateur Radio Digital Communications](https://www.ardc.net/) (ARDC), Jonathan Naylor (G4KLX) has been hired as a full-time software developer. Jonathan is a pioneer of digital voice software, developing software for D-STAR, DMR, System Fusion, M17, NXDN, P.25, and POCSAG.

With a full-time software developer dedicated to the [MMDVM project](https://mmdvm-project.org), many important tasks can be carried out, such as:
- Bug mitigation
- Improving the core code module (MMDVMHost) relating to both the display interfaces and digital modes
- Adding support for industry standards, such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), which is analogous to a fast and reliable texting system that allows devices to communicate efficiently
- Creating a web-based configuration and monitoring solution
- Creating a portable UI on additional hardware platforms
- Adding KISS/AX.25 packet support along with higher speed data rates to run on existing MMDVM hardware
- Porting firmware to next generation microcontrollers

Work has started on the aforementioned software upgrades to MMDVM, and many of the long-term bugs in the software have been fixed. Regarding their progress toward improving MMDVMHost, they have added support for AX.25, and they now provide full support for amateur-driven M17 digital voice protocol. 

Work is currently underway to develop 9600, 19200, and 38400 baud packet modes that support narrow bandwidth using a modulation (4FSK) similar to Digital Mobile Radio (DMR). The packet modes include support for IL2P, which is a new link layer protocol with integral forward error correction (FEC).
