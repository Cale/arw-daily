*The following is a press release from Intrepid-DX Group:*

### Announcing the 6th annual Youth “Dream Rig” Essay Contest.

The [Intrepid-DX Group](https://intrepid-dx.com/) is a California based 501(c)(3) Non-profit organization. Our charter is to promote amateur radio in developing nations. We have conducted amateur radio exhibitions and youth outreach in Iraq, South Sudan, Rotuma, Iran, Ethiopia, Eritrea and North Korea. Six years ago, we began our annual youth “Dream Rig” Essay contest as a further means to reach young people and interest them in our hobby of amateur radio.

This year, we are revising our traditional essay contest and calling it “Amateur Radio for the Greater Good” We greatly appreciate the support and sponsorship of ICOM America and DX Engineering for making this year’s project possible. 

We will be seeking written proposals from young amateurs age 25 or younger, describing how they would establish a Club, Contest, Community or Emergency Communication station to be in a school, church, fire station, community center, hospital or other public building. This station must be in the USA and only US licensed amateurs may submit proposals. This year, rather than our past essays, we are seeking well thought-out and clearly communicated project proposals for a public access amateur radio station.  

We will award one complete station: HF rig, VHF/UHF rig, power supply, coax and antennas to be used by the awardee to establish a station in a public space to be used for amateur radio training, mentoring, club use, contesting and emergency communications. In addition, the awardee will be provided with an additional HF radio for their own use and ownership. 

The equipment provided will include:

1. ICOM IC-7300 HF Transceiver
2. ICOM ID-5100AD VHF/UHF transceiver
3. Power supply 13.8V
4. Two 100’ lengths of DXE 400MAX Coax
5. Comet GP15 VHF/UHF antenna
6. Suitable HF Vertical or Dipole Antenna. 

Project Proposals may be submitted between November 10th and December 10th, 2025. 

We will announce the awardee of the complete station on December 15th, 2025.

This is a departure from our conventional essay contest. We are looking for proposals that would place the station in a secure and common area where it could be enjoyed by other licensed amateurs.

Once the winning proposal is selected, the proposal author will have sixty days to secure written permission from the owner or guardian of the facility. The written permission must indicate approval for the station and antenna to be installed. The proposal author may be the trustee of the station.

Please contact us if you have any questions.

Submissions may be submitted via email to intrepiddxgroup@gmail.com or via US Mail to
