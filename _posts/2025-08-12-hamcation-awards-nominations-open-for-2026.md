### Nominations for HamCationâ€™s 2026 Awards are Now Open
 
Each year during [Hamcation] in Orlando, Florida, deserving contributors to the Amateur Radio community are recognized. These individuals or groups have demonstrated exceptional commitment, dedication, and tenacity, supporting the Amateur Radio community. Kicking off the 2026 HamCation award season, nominations are now open on the HamCation website.
 
For 2026, there will be three award categories: the Gordon West Ambassador of the Year, the Carole Perry Educator of the Year, and a new category, the Amateur Radio Hero of the Year. This new category recognizes groups or individuals who selflessly went above and beyond in providing their skills, equipment, and time for communications duty in the public service during a disaster or moment of need.
