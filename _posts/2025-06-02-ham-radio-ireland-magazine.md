*The following is from Steve (EI5DD), the editor of Ham Radio Ireland Magazine.*

[Ham Radio Ireland Magazine](https://galwayvhfgroup.blogspot.com/2022/06/connacht-regional-radio-newsletter.html), a free E-Magazine is published every second month. It is Ireland's only independent freelance Amateur Radio Magazine geared towards all radio and electronics experimenters. Each month we strive to include all facets of the hobby and include CB, PMR 446, and POC radio information in addition to our regular Ham Radio articles. 

Ham Radio Ireland has gone from strength to strength and we are reaching out to clubs and groups globally. Our Authors are not just form Ireland as we receive articles from many parts of the world. 

Ham Radio Ireland Magazine isn't just about technical content. Our team of writers and editors are also passionate about the social and cultural aspects of the hobby, and we regularly promote activities of Radio Clubs all around Ireland and overseas.
 
Our magazine is distributed to social media sites and available for all to download. Our Magazine is free of charge. We are unbiased and inclusive. We are not affiliated to any club or society so there is no mutual backslapping we just get on with and enjoy the hobby!
