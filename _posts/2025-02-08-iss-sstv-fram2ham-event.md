In preparation for an [upcoming mission](https://fram2ham.com/) to transmit SSTV images from a Space-X Dragon capsule later this spring, a simulation of that event will transmit from the International Space Station (ISS) beginning on February 13th. SSTV images are expected to be transmitted from the ISS from February 13th through February 17th. Unlike previous ISS SSTV events, images will be transmitted on 437.550 MHz rather than the standard 2 meter frequency.

This event is designed to be a practice session for educators and students that will be participating in the Fram2 event later this spring. The practice sessions will help participants get used to the doppler effect of 70 cm as well as getting familiar with equipment. 

More information on the Fram2 event later this spring can be viewed on the [Fram2 website](https://fram2ham.com/). A [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/GYQzmSh5sp) is also available.
