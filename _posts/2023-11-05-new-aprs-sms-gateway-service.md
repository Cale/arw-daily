With [SMSGTE](https://smsgte.org/) shutting down services due to increased spam and regulations requirements, the world of ham radio lost its interface to SMS text messaging via APRS. Recently, NA7Q has stepped in with an updated solution to reintroduce the ability for hams to send SMS text messages through APRS.

While the service has yet to be assigned an official name, details on how to get started may be viewed at [http://theconnectdesk.com/SMS/](http://theconnectdesk.com/SMS/). 

Hat tip to [Zero Retries](https://www.zeroretries.org/) for surfacing this valuable service.
