Sebastian Delmont (KI2D) is the 2025 recipient of the [Amateur Radio Software Award](https://arsaward.com/) for his efforts developing [Ham2K Portable Logger](https://polo.ham2k.com/).

> Ham2K Portable Logger stood out among a competitive field of nominations for its transformative approach to field operations. Designed with intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and a suite of convenient features, the software empowers operators to log, analyze, and share their on-the-go radio activities seamlessly. The Award Committee believes encouraging adventurous portable operations, Ham2K Portable Logger has redefined how enthusiasts engage with the hobbyâ€”whether from mountain summits, parks, or impromptu field setups.

Special event stations (K6A, K6R, K6S) will be on the air in November to celebrate Sebastian Delmont and promote the Amateur Radio Software Award. [Learn more](https://arsaward.com/special-event.html).
