Nathaniel Frissell, Ph.D. (W2NAF), associate professor physics and engineering at The University of Scranton was recently [awarded](https://news.scranton.edu/articles/2024/10/news-faculty-frissell-nsf-dasi-2024.shtml) a grant of $1.8 million by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) to further the efforts of [HamSCI](https://hamsci.org/), a network of ham radio operators helping to measure weather effects among the earth's ionosphere. 

> According to Dr. Frissell, the grant supports the development of a network of 30 standardized receive stations capable of observing high frequency (HF) Doppler shifts, HF amateur radio Weak Signal Propagation Reporter ([WSPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)), pronounced “whisper”) transmissions, very low frequency (VLF) transmissions and natural radio emissions, and the geomagnetic field.

The grant will also fund 10 WSPRSonde transmitters to serve as a source of GPS-stabilized HF beacon signals and will tie into the existing [WSPR network](https://www.wsprnet.org/). 

HamSCI has recently organized the 2023 and 2024 [Solar Eclipse QSO Parties](https://hamsci.org/seqp-faqs/) allowing hams to contribute to scientific studies aimed at understanding how the inonosphere reacts to solar eclipses.
