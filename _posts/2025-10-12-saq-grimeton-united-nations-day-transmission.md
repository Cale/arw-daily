In 1924 the construction of Grimeton Radio Station in Sweden was completed and the two transmitters, invented by Ernst F.W. Alexanderson was put into commercial operation. The radio station call sign was SAQ.

SAQ is the only remaining pre-electronic radio transmitter that has been preserved and is still functional, event though only one of the original two transmitters remain.
