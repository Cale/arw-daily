*The following is a press release from DXLook:*

[DXLook](https://dxlook.com) has released a new D-RAP (D-Region Absorption Prediction) view that helps amateur radio operators understand and visualize HF absorption caused by solar X-ray flares in real time.

D-region absorption is a major cause of sudden daytime HF blackouts, particularly on lower-frequency bands. DXLook’s new D-RAP view presents existing D-region absorption data in a band-aware, geographic format, allowing operators to visually assess where and on which HF bands absorption may be occurring at a given moment.

The D-RAP view is primarily driven by official data from the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, using the global “frequency for 1 dB absorption” product based on GOES satellite X-ray measurements. This dataset identifies, for each region of the Earth, the highest HF frequency expected to experience significant D-layer absorption at the current time.

When NOAA data is unavailable or becomes outdated, DXLook automatically switches to a physics-based fallback model derived from real-time solar position calculations. The system clearly indicates when calculated data is being used instead of measured NOAA data, ensuring transparency for users.

Absorption regions are displayed as smooth, color-coded zones aligned with amateur HF bands, allowing operators to quickly assess which frequencies may be degraded. The D-RAP view integrates with DXLook’s existing MUF, spot, and propagation tools, helping users understand the full operating window between D-layer absorption at lower frequencies and ionospheric refraction limits at higher ones.

The new D-RAP view is especially useful for contest operators, DXers, and emergency communications groups assessing HF reliability during solar events, as well as for operators trying to understand sudden short-wave fadeouts during daylight hours.

The D-RAP view is now live and available to all users at [https://dxlook.com](https://dxlook.com).
