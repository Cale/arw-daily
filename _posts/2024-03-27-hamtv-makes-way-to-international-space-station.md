[SpaceX CRS-30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-30) recently returned the HamTV system back to the International Space Station after the system was sent back to earth for repairs in 2019. The Digital Amateur Television (DATV) equipment powering HamTV is typically used in conjunction with school contacts to send video and audio of the contact events to viewers on earth. 

HamTV was originally operational in 2013 but failed 6 years later in 2019. With the equipment back on board the ISS, AMSAT expects the equipment to be operating in the coming weeks.

The [British Amateur Television Club](https://batc.org.uk/) (BATV) has [extensive documentation](https://wiki.batc.org.uk/HAMTV_from_the_ISS) related to HamTV, including how to receive the DVB-S protocol transmitting from the ISS.
