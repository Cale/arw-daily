[Yaesu](https://www.yaesu.com/) quietly added three new mobile VHF/UHF transceivers to its website. The FT-3185RASP, FT-3165RASP, and FTM-150RASP all focus on Yaesu's Super-DX feature which is designed to improve weak signal reception. While that feature isn't new, Yaesu has added an Audio Digital Signal Processing Unit (ADS) that also activates when engaging Super-DX. ADS is designed to further improve weak signals. All three models include ADS as part of the improved Super-DX feature. Product highlights include:
