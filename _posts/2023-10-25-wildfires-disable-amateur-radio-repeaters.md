Wildfires on Lookout Mountain near Chattanooga, Tennessee have destroyed tower site cabling disabling several amateur radio repeater systems as well as a broadcast FM station.

About 250 acres burned earlier this week before being contained by local emergency agencies. 

Several repeaters at the High Point Repeater Site run by the [Lookout Mountain Amateur Radio Community](https://lmarc.net/club/) (N4LMC) have been offline after the cable run between the building and tower were damaged or destroyed. Systems affected include a Wires-X repeater, a 220MHz repeater, and an APRS digipeater &amp; igate.

Areas of Tennessee, including Chattanooga, are currently experiencing [severe drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) and elevated fire conditions.
