The [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/) board has voted to increase membership dues starting January 1st. In addition, members will be required to pay $25 on top of the membership dues in order to continue receiving printed copies of ARRL magazines such as *QST* and *On the Air*.

ARRL President Rick Roderick called the dues increase "a necessary part of ensuring ARRL is supported so we can continue to promote and fight hard for our Amateur Radio Service..."
