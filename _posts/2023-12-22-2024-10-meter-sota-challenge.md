[Summits on the Air](https://www.sota.org.uk/) (SOTA) has announced a year-long challenge taking place on the 10 meter band. From January 1 to December 31, 2024, SOTA is encouraging the use of 10 meters as solar cycle 25 is projected to peak.

> There will be a special 10m Challenge results page. But note, lots of you said you donâ€™t want SOTA contests and we listened. There will not be an overall winner or association winners.
