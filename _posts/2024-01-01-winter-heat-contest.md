In its 5th year, [WINTERHEAT](https://hamactive.com/) is active January 1 through January 31. The event encourages hams to get on the air and accumulate as many VHF/UHF simplex contacts as possible. The longer event period allows hams to make adjustments to their capabilities for a continuous improvement mindset. 

WINTERHEAT also utilizes a unique, web based logging system that displays real-time logging and statistics. Contacts are to be made via FM voice, including digital voice modes such as DMR, Fusion, and D-STAR.
