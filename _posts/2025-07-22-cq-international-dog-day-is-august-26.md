*The following is a message from KD2GUT:* 

When a group of radio operators begin calling “[CQ International Dog Day](https://dogdayradio.org/)” in August, they’re not just looking for QSOs.

They are in search of people who have room in their hearts to help the abandoned, abused and homeless dogs around the world in whatever way they can. These dozen or so special event operators know the power of rescue because they’ve been deeply involved in it themselves: Hanz YL3JD and his wife opened their home – first in Holland, later in Latvia – and have given needy dogs a second chance at a new family. In Australia, and later in Germany, Ed DD5LP and his wife discovered – several times – that their household was incomplete without canine company. Many of the other operators’ rescued dogs were adopted after hard lives on the street; others were at the pound, hours away from being euthanized.

International Dog Day (and in the US, National Dog Day) is August 26 every year. The tradition was created by US pet advocate Colleen Paige as a day to recognise the needs of society’s unwanted and cast-off dogs and affirm the commitment to adopt, donate or raise awareness of their special needs.

Hanz amplified the original message by adding an amateur radio component in 2022, taking the special-event callsign YL1DOG and operating as a single station. The following year he was joined by Chris, G5VZ, and David, G4YVM, in the UK. By 2024, a team of 10 US rescue-dog advocates, operating as K2D, had come on board. This year is the biggest yet, as hams in Germany and other countries run with the pack. All operators will be looking to hear from dog-lovers and supporters in either CW or SSB on HF, on VHF/UHF simplex, or via DMR and Echolink.

The international team has added incentive certificates, including special endorsements such as “Full Kennel,” the equivalent of a clean sweep. Their website, [dogdayradio.org](https://dogdayradio.org/), is updated regularly with the operators’ special-event callsigns, their operating schedules, a chance to meet the dogs who inspired them and hear their stories.

In case you are wondering where the cats are – well, they’re running ahead of the dogs! International Cat Day will be operating as a separate event, two weeks before the Dog Day operators get on the air – and they will be carrying a similar message for cat-rescue awareness.  See catdayradio.org for details.

Meanwhile, be aware that all special-event operators will be working like dogs – and why not? – because they want to hear and share as many rescue stories as they can.
