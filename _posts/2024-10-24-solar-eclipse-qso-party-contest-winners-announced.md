The [Solar Eclipse QSO Party](https://hamsci.org/seqp-faqs/) provided hams an opportunity to operate during both the 2023 and 2024 solar eclipses. In addition to the contest, the event contributed to scientific studies focusing on the ionosphereâ€™s reaction to the eclipse. The 2024 contest results have been released with Dennis Egan (W1UE) taking the top spot in the single op category and [Souris Valley Amateur Radio Club](https://www.k0ajw.com/) (K0AJW) taking the top spot in the multi op category. More information and full results are available on the [HamSCI website](https://hamsci.org/2024-SEQP-results).
