18 amateur radio clubs will activate the Erie Canal for Parks on the Air September 16-25 to celebrate the canal's 200th anniversary.

*The following is a message from K2EAG:* 

After 6 months of planning, our state-wide activation of the Erie Canal for its 200th Anniversary is here! 

This event is a great opportunity to experience and share about the canal that transformed America, as clubs and individuals across New York State join together over the airwaves to activate the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor.

We're excited to share the 18 clubs that will be activating the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor for this huge celebration--just like how each town celebrated upon the completion of the Erie Canal and their excitement of Governor DeWitt Clinton's inaugural voyage as he crossed New York State!

These clubs, and many more individuals, are planning [Parks On The Air](https://parksontheair.com/) (POTA) activations within the [Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor](https://pota.app/#/park/US-6532) (US-6532) from Sept 16-25. For those activating along the canal (which is encouraged), they might also be activating the [Empire State Trail](https://pota.app/#/park/US-8098) (US-8098), which is a common two-fer with the corridor. The Heritage Corridor is a large area that also includes Cayuga and Seneca Lakes, and even north of Albany, so regardless of location in the state, there are a lot of eligible locations and possible n-fers (activating from multiple POTA entities at once).

As most of the clubs will be activating on Saturday and Sunday, we are also seeking individual activators to join us over the remaining days. We hope to fill the [pota.app](https://pota.app) spotting page with [US-6532](https://pota.app/#/park/US-6532) Erie Canalway over the 10 days, so be sure to spot with US-6532 as the primary park number, when operating from multiple POTA entities. 

This is not a contest, it's an operating event. All bands and modes are allowed. Take your time and be ready to share about the canal over the air. The canal has an important history for New York State and the country. Clubs and individuals are encouraged to make this their own event, operate with your own style, and consider if you'll also create a commemorative QSL for your contacts. We do however ask that you promptly upload your logs to POTA, clubs should ensure that both station callsign (club call) and operator (individual) both get logged, so both the club and individual can get credit with Parks On The Air.

Please share your activations to social media, we recommend including the following tags in your posts: #ErieCanal200 #ErieCanalway #parksontheair, please also send your experiences and results to [k2eag@arrl.net](mailto:k2eag@arrl.net) --- we can't wait to hear all the stories, see the location and learn how things went! 

If you or your club has any questions at all about participating in the event or how to get started with POTA, please don't hesitate to reply back and I'll help any way I can. 

73,

Matt K2EAG, Angela N3ARB and Mike N2MAK
