*The following is a press release from the Alberta Digital Radio Society:*

Calgary, Alberta, Jan 23rd, 2026. The [Alberta Digital Radio Society](https://adrcs.org/) is pleased to announce that it has chosen Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as the modulation method for the enhanced data mode on its IP400 Supernode. “This mode will enable higher data rates than have previously been achieved with conventional FM Radios”, says Martin Alcock, VE6VH, founder of the [IP400 project](https://ip400.adrcs.org/), who goes on to say “and it will provide us with the ability to extend the network to a mobile station on a conventional repeater which can be in either the 2M, 220, 440 and 900 bands, and with no radio modifications required”. The goals of the IP400 project are not only to implement a higher speed mesh network on the 400MHz band, but also to breathe new life into analog repeaters with a simple data upgrade, which will result in the addition of three modes: a 4FSK compatible mode on 400MHz, and a high speed OFDM mode at 2.39GHz for linking and backbone purposes, and a slower audio band OFDM mode that is designed to work with existing VHF and UHF radios.

**Editor's note**   
*Additional updates have recently been posted to the [ADRCS news page](https://adrcs.org/adrcs/news/):*

> ...the society is pleased to announce that its power node is now in development and that the specification for the supernode is now available for developers.

> the IP400 supernode is now entering its development phase. This node provides a data upgrade with two native modes: a compatible 4FSK mode on 400MHz a high speed OFDM mode on the 2.9GHz band for backbone data network implementations, combined into a single RF modem. The hardware will be a HAT module for an existing raspberry Pi system, which can operate either in a standalone mode or as a simple upgrade to an existing AllstarLink system. A third data mode is currently in the design phase, which will enable IP400 traffic on conventional FM radios. Copies of the specification are available on the [private] developer [GitHub site](https://github.com/adrcs/ip400), or to members upon request. The OFDM mode development is being sponsored by a grant from ARDC.
