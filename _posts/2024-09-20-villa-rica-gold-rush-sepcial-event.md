The [West Georgia Amateur Radio Society](https://wgars.com/) will hold its second annual *[Villa Rica Gold Rush](https://wgars.com/events/gold-rush)* special event September 21st-22nd, 2024 using the W4G Call Sign on 15, 20, 40, and 80 meters in CW, Phone, and Digital modes. Operation on all modes and bands, including the 10 meter bonus band, will occur on September 21<sup>st</sup> from 12:30Z until 19:30Z from the original Pine Mountain Gold Mine Operations Building at the [Pine Mountain Gold Museum](http://www.pinemountaingoldmuseum.com/) in Villa Rica, GA. W4G will operate outside those hours using bands and modes chosen by our individual operators. The event runs in conjunction with the *[Villa Rica Gold Rush Festival](https://www.villarica.org/calendarview.aspx?cid=22152)*, celebrating Villa Rica's status as the home of the first U.S. Gold Rush.

Certificates for making a single contact, all bands, all modes, and bonus band contacts will be made available. When the event begins we'll put up a status page which will include the operators and bands they are operating on, as well as recent contacts. Please note that some operators will manually log their contacts and may not immediately appear on our status page. Certificates are normally available within moments of making contact, however it may take up to 24 hours for digital and manually logged contacts.
