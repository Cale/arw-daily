[ITU-R](https://www.itu.int/) has [recommended an approach](https://www.iaru-r1.org/2023/itu-r-recommendation-m-2164-on-23cm-amateur-service-and-rnss-operations-now-published-in-time-for-wrc-23-discussions/) for amateur radio operators to continue working alongside non-amateur services on the 23cm satellite bands. Specifically, there has been concern that amateur radio might lose access to spectrum alongside the co-frequency radio navigation satellite service (RNSS).

The recommendation represents 4 years of advocacy on behalf of [IARU](https://www.iaru-r1.org/) and will be discussed at [WRC-23](https://dubaiwrc23.ae/) through mid-December.
