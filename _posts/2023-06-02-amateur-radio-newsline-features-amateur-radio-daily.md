Huge thanks to [Amateur Radio Newsline](https://www.arnewsline.org/) for featuring [Amateur Radio Daily](https://daily.hamweekly.com/) on their latest weekly report of ham radio news stories. 

I've been emailing back and forth with Ed, DD5LP, and have learned a lot about the ARNewsline process. They're a professional outfit run completely on a volunteer basis and they do a fantastic job each week. ARNewsline is a wonderful service provided to the ham radio community. 

If you have a repeater in your area that relays ARNewsline, be sure to tune in. You can also hear [this week's episode on the web](https://www.arnewsline.org/news/2023/6/1/amateur-radio-newsline-report-2379-for-friday-june-2nd-2023).
