[ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/) [announced](https://www.arrl.org/news/view/arrl-announces-logbook-of-the-world-systems-upgrade) this week that [Logbook of The World](https://lotw.arrl.org/) (LoTW) will receive much needed technical upgrades including a move to a cloud computing platform. In addition to upgrades to the operating system and database that the service relies on, the entire product will move to the cloud. LoTW currently resides on physical hardware at ARRL HQ. A move to a proper datacenter will provide protections from both physical and network based security risks. 

> As a part of the ongoing modernization of the ARRL systems infrastructure, LoTW will be receiving major upgrades to the operating system it is running on, the relational database system it uses to store and access logbook and awards data, and server hosting, where it will be fully migrated to the cloud.

The cloud migration will require LoTW to be offline June 27th through July 2nd.
