The [Radio Society of Great Britain](https://rsgb.org/) (RSGB) will host a [LoRa High Altitude Balloon Challenge](https://rsgb.org/main/coding-and-amateur-radio/lora-balloon-project/) on September 20th. This event will be part of [RSGB's National Coding Week](https://rsgb.org/main/coding-and-amateur-radio/) where participants will be asked to build their own LoRa tracker. Participants with signals furthest from the balloon could be eligible for a prize.

The balloon event is part of RSGB's strategy to [help develop practical skills](https://rsgb.org/main/blog/news/gb2rs/headlines/2025/07/25/get-involved-with-the-rsgb-lora-high-altitude-balloon-challenge/).
