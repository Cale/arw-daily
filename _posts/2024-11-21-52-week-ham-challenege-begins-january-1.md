Fabian Kurz (DJ5CW), creator of [Learn CW Online](https://lcwo.net/), recently announced the 2025 [52 Week Ham Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/). The challenge consists of weekly exercises ranging from designing QSL cards to receiving a station on 6m via sporadic E.

> This is meant to inspire you to extend your horizon in amateur radio by weekly challenges through the year that touch all aspects of ham radio (and related fields). A lot of the challenges may be trivial for some participants (because it is what they do all the time), but very challenging to others. Participants of the challenge are encouraged to help each other in any way possible.

Participants are encouraged to post progress through social media using the #hamchallenge hashtag. An [IRC channel](https://web.libera.chat/#hamchallenge) is also available.
