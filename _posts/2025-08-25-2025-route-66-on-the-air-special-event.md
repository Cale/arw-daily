The [2025 Route 66 On The Air](https://w6jbt.org/?page_id=15) special event will be active September 6-14. This year, [24 clubs](https://w6jbt.org/?page_id=117) located across the route will be operating special 1x1 callsigns. [QSL cards](https://w6jbt.org/?page_id=26) and [certificates](https://w6jbt.org/?page_id=23) will be available.

> This year marks the 26th year of this great radio event. Originally started by the Northern Arizona DX Association, it was a way to allow amateur radio operators a fun way to “Relive the Ride.” They also can relive their own memories of Route 66, and get to celebrate the highway’s rich history in making the U.S. what it is today.
