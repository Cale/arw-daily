Open Research Institute has [released](https://www.openresearch.institute/2025/08/04/but-wait-theres-more/) a beta version of the Opulent Voice based conference server, Locus. The beta round includes FDMA uplink channels, conference management, and a DVB-S2 downlink multiplexer. 

> By targeting the IP address of opulent.openresearch.institute, anyone running Interlocutor can participate on ORIâ€™s demonstration conference repeater. This repeater is internet-only at the moment, but will have RF hardware in the next phase of work.

The software may be downloaded from the [Locus GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/locus).
