"More than 100 members of the U.S. House of Representatives now are pressuring carmakers to keep AM radio reception in cars.

These members, from both political parties, signed a letter led by Reps. Bob Latta and Greg Pence asking the car companies to retain AM radio.

They also asked the 10 companies to 'provide the details and the value of all federal loan, grant and tax incentives your company has received in the last 15 years' and whether those subsidies could help the companies offset the cost to mitigate interference. And they asked whether the car companies plan to charge customers for 'subscription-like access to free AM/FM radio in any vehicles.'"
