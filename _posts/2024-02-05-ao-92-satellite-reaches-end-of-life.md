Fox-1D (AO-92) was an [AMSAT](https://www.amsat.org/) CubeSat satellite that operated for just over 6 years in orbit and proved to be a popular option for amateur radio satellite operators through its FM transponder. In addition to the transponder, the versatile satellite contained several payloads including an L-band converter, an experimental camera, and a MEMS GYRO experiment.

With aging batteries, the satellite could no longer operate reliably and was mostly inoperable in recent months. The satellite reentered earth's orbit on February 3rd.
