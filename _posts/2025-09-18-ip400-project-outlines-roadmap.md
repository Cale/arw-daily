During a presentation by Garvin (VE6GFC) at [Zero Retries Digital Conference](), [ADRCS](https://adrcs.org/) communicated a project plan for the [IP400 Project](https://ip400.adrcs.org/).

Highlights of upcoming phases include:

- Increasing data speeds from 600Kb/s to 2.5Mb/s
- Remote hardware operation
- New form factor for Mini Node II

A design for *Next Generation Node Hardware II* describes an all-in-one transceiver unit made up of node hardware, a power amplifier, and 9dB gain antenna.

More details are available from the [presentation slide deck](https://github.com/adrcs/Presentations/tree/main/ZRDC) on the [IP400 GitHub](https://github.com/adrcs/ip400) space.

**About the Alberta Digital Radio Communications Society**   
Alberta Digital Radio Communications Society (ADRCS) was formed in 2022 to promote the use and develop new technologies using digital communication in Amateur Radio. It is the sponsor of the AREDN network in Western Canada, and the IP400 Project.

The IP400 Project aims to deliver a data communications system capable of 100 kbps minimum data speeds. Initial hardware in the form of Raspberry Pi Zero HAT transceivers were demoed at Hamvention.
