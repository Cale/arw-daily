[Zero Retries Digital Conference](https://www.zeroretries.radio/conference/) (ZRDC) will return for a second year on Friday, October 16, 2026. This year's conference will take place in Sam Ramon, California, USA at the [Roundhouse Conference Center](https://www.roundhouse-sr.com/). [Pacificon](https://www.pacificon.org/) 2026 will take place the same weekend in the same city, just down the street from ZRDC.

An informal visit to the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/visit/) will take place the Thursday before ZRDC 2026. (Editor's note: A visit to CHM is worth arriving early!)

Keep an eye on the [ZRDC 2026 website](https://www.zeroretries.radio/conference/) for more details.
