The [National Traffic System](https://nts2.arrl.org/) (NTS) will soon be evaluated with new tools to help improve system performance. The ARRL is [developing](https://nts2.arrl.org/july-2024-nts-letter/) a web-based Performance Analysis Tool (PAT) to ultimately improve speed and accuracy of the traffic system. Additional training materials will also be developed to improve NTS performance. Once the new tools are complete, the ARRL will hold a test exercise to measure their effectiveness.
