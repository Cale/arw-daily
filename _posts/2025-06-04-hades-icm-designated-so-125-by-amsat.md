AMSAT has designated the recently launched HADES-ICM satellite as SO-125 (Spain-OSCAR 125). SO-125 was launched from a Falcon 9 rocket as HADES-ICM in March of this year. The satellite is a 1.5U PocketQube and contains an SDR based FM and digital repeater for amateur radio use. 

> The satellite carries an FM and digital repeater payload, built on an improved SDR-based platform capable of transmitting up to 0.25W when battery conditions allow. This makes it accessible to stations using handheld antennas like the Arrow antenna.
