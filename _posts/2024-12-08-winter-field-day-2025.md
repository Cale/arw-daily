[Winter Field Day](https://winterfieldday.org/) will take place January 25th through the 26th. This year's event offers a few notable updates including extended operating hours from 24 to 30. Locations are no longer required to remain fixed for the duration of the event and *bonuses* have been renamed to *multipliers*, with new multipliers added for 2025.

> The Winter Field Day event aims to help participants improve their preparedness for disasters and enhance their operational abilities in adverse conditions. Amateur radio operators have the freedom to use frequencies on the HF, VHF, or UHF bands while employing voice, CW, and digital transmissions.

All modes are accepted except for FT4 and FT8. See the [rules](https://winterfieldday.org/sop.php) for more details. Winter Field Day locations may be [registered](https://winterfieldday.org/register-location.php) ahead of time.
