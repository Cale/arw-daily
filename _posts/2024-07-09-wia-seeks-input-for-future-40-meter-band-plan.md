The [Wireless Institute of Australia](https://www.wia.org.au/) (WIA) is [requesting feedback](https://www.wia.org.au/newsevents/news/2024/20240709-1/index.php) from members and general amateur operators to move closer to a standardized 40 meter band plan across the globe. Feedback will be relayed to the IARU. The WIA describes the 40 meter band as one of the more disorganized bands in terms of global alignment on frequency use. Issues include: 

- Inconsistent IARU member society band plans
- National regulatory constraints (FCC)
- Outdated band plans still in place following the band expansion granted at WRC2003
- Wider use of digital modes

Hams may [visit the WIA website](https://www.wia.org.au/newsevents/news/2024/20240709-1/index.php) to submit responses.
