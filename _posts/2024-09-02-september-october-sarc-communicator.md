## The September - October SARC Communicator

We're back with another big issue to start the fall season. The September-October 2024 Communicator, digital periodical of Surrey Amateur Radio Communications is now available for viewing or download. Some great projects and articles in this issue including a CW decoder, an HF amplifier and a web server for HamClock using an inexpensive Raspberry Pi Zero. Also a full report on our July Surrey Summer High School  RF Communications course that resulted in 20 new hams aged 14-17.

Read in over 150 countries, we bring you 125+ pages of Amateur Radio content from the Southwest corner of Canada and elsewhere. With less fluff and ads than other Amateur Radio publications, you will find Amateur Radio related articles, projects, profiles, news, tips and how-to's for all levels of the hobby.
