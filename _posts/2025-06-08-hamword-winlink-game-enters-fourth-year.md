[Hamword](https://hambooks.org/hamword/) has [completed three years](https://forums.qrz.com/index.php?threads/hamword-winlink-game-the-third-year.955953/) serving hams a daily word game that is similar to the popular Wordle guessing game. Hamword takes place over [Winlink](https://winlink.org/) which provides amateur radio operators with an opportunity to maintain brain health and practice their Winlink communication skills.

Nearly 500 hams have played over 11,000 games over the last three years.

> You can join the fun by sending a five-letter word to the Winlink tactical callsign HAMWORD. You do not have to send messages using your radio connection. Winlink messages can be transferred over the Internet using the Telnet interface.

More information about Hamword and how to play is available on the [Hamword website](https://hambooks.org/hamword/).
