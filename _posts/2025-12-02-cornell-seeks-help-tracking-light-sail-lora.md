The [Cornell Alpha CubeSat mission](https://alphacubesat.cornell.edu/) is seeking assistance in receiving telemetry from its [light sail](https://alphacubesat.cornell.edu/lightsail.html) [ChipSats](https://alphacubesat.cornell.edu/chipsats.html) which will be transmitting telemetry via LoRa transceivers. The light sail is expected to be active for a 48 hour period before reentering earth's atmosphere. Currently, the CubeSat containing the light sail is expected to deploy from the International Space Station on December 2nd at 3:20 AM Eastern Time. The light sail is expected to deploy from the CubeSat a few days later.

> Alpha is a 1U CubeSat developed by students of
the [Space Systems Design Studio](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/) at Cornell
University. Among several technology
demonstrations onboard, the primary mission
objective is to deploy a retroreflective laser sail
into low Earth orbit. The light sail fully separates
from the CubeSat and becomes its own free-flying spacecraft thanks to gram-scale flight
computers, “[ChipSats](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/chip-satellites),” mounted to the sail.

The ChipSats will transmit telemetry on 437.4 MHz. Additional details on receiving LoRa signals from the light sail are [available here](https://cornell.app.box.com/s/n4se5ku0ltjb1of2piagfz1y7xa92n47).
