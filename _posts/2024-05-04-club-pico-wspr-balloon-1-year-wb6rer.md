A pico balloon launched by the [Hualapai Amateur Radio Club](https://wb6rer.net/) will mark 1 year in orbit on May 19th. The balloon contains a 20 meter [WSPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_%28amateur_radio_software%29) beacon from [QRP Labs](https://qrp-labs.com/). Overcoming a damaged dipole antenna, telemetry from the balloon was recently received by two stations in Australia.

> [The balloon] is now starting another trip across the Pacific Ocean heading due east toward South America, so we probably will not hear from it for a while. The balloon is a hydrogen filled 32" Yokohama brand clear sphere which are purchased from Japan.
