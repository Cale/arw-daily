[Radio Amateurs of Canada](https://www.rac.ca/) (RAC), the national association for amateur radio in Canada, has voted to cancel plans to attend and operate a booth at [Hamvention](https://hamvention.org/) in Ohio. The organization cited heightened tensions between Canada and the United States as contributing to its decision. 

> The relationship between Canada and the United States has become increasingly strained due to recent trade disputes and tariffs imposed by the US government. Adding to these challenges, controversial remarks from US leaders, including suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st state, have heightened concerns about Canadian sovereignty.

RAC hopes to return to Hamvention in the future.
