[ARDC](https://www.ardc.net/) has launched [4Net Connect](https://connect.44net.cloud/), a new portal designed to make it easier for ham radio operators to gain access to and experiment with subnets of the 44.0.0.0/8 IP address space. Through the portal, hams can apply for VPN access to [44Net](https://www.ardc.net/44net/) which comes with a dedicated 44Net IP address. Tunnel services are provided through [WireGuard]() with options to add IP networks and autonomous system numbers. Proof of ham radio license is required.

Hams can get started at [https://connect.44net.cloud/](https://connect.44net.cloud/). An overview of 44Net is available on the [44Net Wiki](https://wiki.ampr.org/wiki/Home).
