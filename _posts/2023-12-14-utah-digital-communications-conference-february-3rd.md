The [Utah Digital Communications Conference](https://utah-dcc.square.site/) will take place February 3rd, 2024 and is currently [calling for proposals](https://forms.gle/oLN2HdyLJCHb9gav5). 

> The conference will bring together the worlds of amateur radio and making. As the pioneer of digital modes, amateur radio continues to evolve with the incorporation of technology. This conference will focus on the use of digital modes in the amateur radio hobby, including cutting-edge topics such as digital modes for emergency communication and DIY components.

The conference will include door prizes, demo tables, a fox hunt, and digital get on the air (GOATA) stations running DMR and FT8.
