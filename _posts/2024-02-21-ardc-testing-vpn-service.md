In an interview recorded at Hamcation 2024, [ARDC discussed a VPN service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm6wXZ9Xst0) currently in testing that would provide access to 44Net from essentially any VPN enabled device.

John Hays (K7VE) showed a GL-iNet [Puli (GL-XE300)](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-xe300/) portable LTE gateway capable of running the VPN.

ARDC's VPN service is currently in testing utilizing the open-source [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN protocol. A public beta is planned for later in 2024.
