*The following is a message from the Japan Amateur Radio League (JARL).*

The [Japan Amateur Radio League, Inc.](https://www.jarl.org/) (Headquarters: Toshima-ku, Tokyo; President: Koji MORITA, JA5SUD), hereinafter JARL, is proud to support [Expo 2025](https://www.expo2025.or.jp/) Osaka, Kansai, Japan as an official Site Operation Supplier. In this role, JARL is operating a special commemorative amateur radio station, [8K3EXPO](https://www.jarl.org/English/8_info/expo2025.html), at the Expo venue to promote the event.

### JARL’s Contribution to the Expo

By operating an amateur radio station at the Expo site, JARL will promote the event not only across Japan but all over the world through the global amateur radio community. This initiative aims to enhance public awareness and excitement on the Expo, and to foster international exchange.

### Details of the Special Commemorative Station
- Operation period：April 13 (Sun) – October 13 (Mon), 2025, 184 days (Full duration of the Expo)
- Callsign：8K3EXPO (for both fixed and mobile stations)
- Frequency and Power:1.8 MHz – 10 GHz, up to 1kW (planned)

This is the first amateur radio station in history to be assigned a call sign starting with "8K" — a prefix symbolizing Kansai and Kinki.

### JA3XPO: A Mobile Commemorative Station

In addition to 8K3EXPO, JARL will also operate JA3XPO, a mobile commemorative station that will travel to each of the Kansai prefectures. This callsign, originally used for the 1970 Japan World Exposition in Suita, Osaka, has been revived after 55 years. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who supported us.

### How to Operate 8K3EXPO

The operation booth is staffed by volunteers mainly from JARL’s Kansai Regional Headquarters and branches. Licensed amateur radio operators are welcome to operate the commemorative station.

For those without a license, trial operations under supervision are available—everyone is welcome to try. Please don’t hesitate to speak with the staff on site.

## Operating Eligibility for Overseas Visitors

Visitors with amateur radio license that was issued by countries that have a reciprocal license agreement with Japan may operate the 8K3EXPO station. For details, please refer to: [https://www.jarl.org/English/3_Application/Annex.htm](https://www.jarl.org/English/3_Application/Annex.htm)

Even if you do not have such a license, you may still enjoy operating the station through a supervised trial experience.
For inquiries, feel free to contact JARL’s International Division at intl@jarl.org well in advance of your arrival in Japan.

### Important Notice

Please note that Radio communication equipment such as amateur radio equipment, specified low-power radio equipment, walkie-talkies, etc. are prohibited within the Expo site (excluding mobile phones, radios, PCs and tablets). While it may be tempting to use handheld radios inside the venue, we ask for your cooperation in not bringing such equipment, while only station staff are granted special permission to do so.

### Opening Ceremony Held on April 13

The commemorative station opened on April 13, 2025, with an opening ceremony at 10:00 a.m. After the first QSO by JARL President Koji Morita (JA5SUD), 8K3EXPO made contact with many domestic and international stations.
