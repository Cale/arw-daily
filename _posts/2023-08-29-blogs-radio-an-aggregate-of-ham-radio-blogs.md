DK1MI aims to promote the ham radio hobby by elevating lesser known websites and create a central location to find the latest news about amateur radio. An [OPML file of all RSS feeds](https://codeberg.org/mclemens/Ham-Radio-RSS-Feeds) is available.

Amateur Radio Daily is proud to be among the blogs listed at [blogs.radio](https://blogs.radio). Thanks to [DK1MI](https://dk1mi.radio/) for creating this service.
