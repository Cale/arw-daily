Amateur Radio on the International Space Station ([ARISS](https://ariss-usa.org/)) and the American Radio Relay League ([ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/)) plan to conduct a special SSTV event utilizing the amateur radio repeater on the International Space Station (ISS). On July 26th between 20:05 UTC (16:05 ET) and 20:20 UTC (16:20 ET), a special SSTV message will be transmitted. The ISS pass will be over the mid atlantic region of the US during this event. The message may be recieved at 437.800 MHz. Hams are encouraged to listen for the message, but are asked to refrain from using the ISS repeater during this time.
