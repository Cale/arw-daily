[Connect Systems](https://www.csi-radios.com/) has begun shipping the first radios that operate M17 "out of the box." The [M17 project](https://m17project.org/) is an Open Source digital mode alternative to modes such as DSTAR and System Fusion which rely on proprietary encoding and decoding hardware and software.

The [CS7000 M17](https://www.csi-radios.com/cs7000-m17/) is an HT transceiver running M17 described as "4FSK modulation with an open source Protocol and Vocoder." A "PLUS" [version](https://www.csi-radios.com/cs7000-m17-plus/) of the HT with additional memory and processing power will also be available.

See more information about the [M17 Project](https://m17project.org/).
