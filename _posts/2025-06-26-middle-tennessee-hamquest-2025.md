> Weâ€™ve come a long way from being in an 8,000 sq. foot open air pavilion to an over 20,000 sq. foot state of the art exhibit hall! Once again, we continue our Quest to be the best! Join our 10-year celebration as we continue to grow our Hamfest and Electronics Expo.

The event includes VE testing, tailgating, commercial vendors, presentations, and more.
