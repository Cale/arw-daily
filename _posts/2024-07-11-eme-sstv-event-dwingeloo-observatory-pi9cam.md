The C.A. Muller Radio Astronomy Station (PI9CAM) will utilize the [Dwingeloo Radio Telescope](https://www.camras.nl/en/) to conduct an [EME SSTV Party](https://groups.io/g/Moon-Net/message/47228) on July 13th. The event celebrates the Apollo 11 moon landing by transmitting moon landing and spacecraft images to the moon using SSTV on 23cm (1296.110 MHz).

Look for activity between 13:00 and 21:00 UTC on July 13th. The MARTIN2 SSTV mode will be utilized with the [MMSSTV](https://hamsoft.ca/pages/mmsstv.php) software.

Leading up to the event, PI9CAM will be available for EME QSOs on 70, 23, and 13cm in all modes.

A [WebSDR is available](https://www.camras.nl/en/visitor-info/listen-in/) to listen in on the telescope's live reception activity.

See the [Moon-Net](https://groups.io/g/Moon-Net/message/47228) mailing list for more information.
