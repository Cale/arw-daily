Special event station [4X19RAV](https://www.qrz.com/db/4X19RAV) will operate from Israel December 7th through December 12th to celebrate Yud Tet Kislev.

> Yud Tet Kislev (the 19th of Kislev) is celebrated as the “New Year” of Chassidic teachings. On this day in 1798 (19 Kislev 5559), the founder of Chabad Chassidism, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi (the Alter Rebbe), was released from imprisonment in Czarist Russia. His arrest was an attempt to suppress the spreading of Chassidic philosophy; his miraculous liberation is seen as a victory for Jewish spiritual freedom and the dissemination of Torah and Chassidut.
