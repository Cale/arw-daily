The AMSAT Field Day 2023 event is open to all Amateur Radio operators.  Amateurs are to use the exchange as specified in ARRL rules for Field Day. The AMSAT competition is to encourage the use of all amateur satellites, both analog and digital. Note that no points will be credited for any contacts beyond the ONE allowed via each single-channel FM satellite. Operators are encouraged not to make any extra contacts via theses satellites (Ex: SO-50). CW contacts and digital contacts are worth three points as [outlined below](https://www.amsat.org/ans-134-amsat-news-service-weekly-bulletins/).
