*The following is a press release from the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program:*

The [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program]() (HAARP) will be conducting a research
campaign November 17-22 UTC, with operating times specified in the table below. Operating
frequencies will vary, but all HAARP transmissions will be between 2.75 MHz and 10 MHz. Actual
transmit days and times are highly variable based on real-time ionospheric and/or geomagnetic
conditions. All information is subject to change.

This campaign is being conducted in support of research proposals from the University of Alaska
Fairbanks, Aerospace Corporation, the University of Colorado-Denver, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University, the University of Florida, Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, the
Naval Research Laboratory, and the University of Texas-San Antonio. This research is supported
by the Subauroral Geophysical Observatory award (#2054361) from the National Science
Foundation. Scientific goals of these experiments include studies on the effects of ionospheric
conditions on high-frequency radio wave propagation and generation and propagation of
extremely low frequency/very low frequency (ELF/VLF) waves. This campaign will also introduce a
Rayleigh LIDAR system as a new diagnostic tool for measuring temperature and density at an
altitude of 11-85 km. More information on the LIDAR is available here:

The table below contains some of the frequencies that are expected to be used for these
experiments. Note that these are subject to change based on real-time conditions in the
ionosphere. The included transmission notice supplement contains information on the
frequencies HAARP is authorized to transmit. HAARP transmissions will only occur on our
authorized frequencies. There are no specific data collection requests from funded investigators,
but reception reports are appreciated and may be submitted to our online form at
