To reach hams in areas not serviced by a [National Traffic System](https://nts2.arrl.org/) (NTS) net on local repeaters, the [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/) has created the [Virtual NTS Training Net](https://nts2.arrl.org/2025/03/15/virtual-nts-training-net/) (VNTN). Like a traditional traffic net, the virtual version will accept check-ins and radiograms over Zoom. VNTN currently meets on Wednesdays at 7:00 PM Eastern time. Hams can join the virtual net [here](https://bitl.to/3xj4).
