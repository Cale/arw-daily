*The following is a message from the [ROC-HAM Radio Network](https://www.roc-ham.net/):*

**[ROC-HAM Radio Network celebrates 200th anniversary of the ERIE CANAL](https://www.roc-ham.net/erie-canal-bicentennial/) with a special event callsign [W2R](https://www.qrz.com/db/W2R), from SEPTEMBER 1ST - SEPTEMBER 29TH. W2JLD will be on the air celebrating the 200th anniversary of the ERIE CANAL.**

The [Erie Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal) is a historic waterway in New York State, connecting the Atlantic Ocean via the Hudson River to the Great Lakes at Lake Erie. Completed in 1825, it was North America's first navigable waterway linking the two systems and the greatest public works project of its time. The canal was an immense commercial success, dramatically reducing transportation costs and fostering the growth of cities like Buffalo and Rochester, and playing a vital role in New York's rise as the "Empire State". Today, the original canal is part of the New York State Barge Canal and is primarily used for recreational boating and as part of the multiuse Empire State Trail.

**Key Facts & History**

- Construction:   
Built between 1817 and 1825, the original canal was 363 miles long, stretching from Albany to Buffalo. 

- Engineering Feat:   
It was a massive undertaking, featuring locks that raised boats significant heights. 

- Commercial Impact:   
The canal was an instant commercial and financial success, with tolls completely repaying the construction loan within nine years. It significantly lowered the cost of moving goods and people, creating new markets and routes for settlers. 

- Economic Growth:   
The Erie Canal helped make New York City the nation's premier seaport and spurred the development of towns along its route. 

- Modernization:   
In the early 20th century, the canal was overhauled to create the New York State Barge Canal, allowing larger steamships to pass through. 

**Today**

- Recreation:   
The New York State Canal System, including the Erie Canal, is now a major route for recreational boating. 

- Tourism:   
Numerous museums, canal sites, and historical remnants along the route showcase the canal's legacy and engineering. 

- Empire State Trail:   
Many portions of the former canal towpath have been converted into a multi-use trail for walking and cycling, forming part of the Empire State Trail.

[W2JLD](https://www.qrz.com/db/W2JLD) will be transmitting at various sites throughout downtown Rochester,NY.

Cobbs Hill Park was part of the western waterways system that allowed boats to turn around in a large body of water. The Erie Canal ran thru part of his neighborhood, known as lock #66, there is a large portion of it which is visible from the expressway here in Rochester,NY.
