### DXLook Launches “Realtime View — Live HF Propagation at Your Fingertips

[DXLook](https://dxlook.com/) has introduced a brand-new feature called Realtime View, giving amateur radio operators the ability to watch HF propagation unfold live — second by second — anywhere in the world.

If you’ve ever wanted to see where signals are being heard right now, or track a band opening as it happens, this new view makes it possible. Realtime View connects to live reports from PSK Reporter and instantly displays digital mode activity — including FT8, FT4, and more — as colorful arcs showing real signal paths across the globe.

🌎 **What You’ll See**   
- Spots appearing within seconds of real reception
- Live visualization of band openings and activity
- Filters to focus by callsign, grid square, or band
- Works great on mobile and desktop devices

Realtime View focuses exclusively on digital modes, so you’ll see real data from live transmissions — no models or predictions. It’s perfect for testing antennas, chasing DX, or simply exploring what’s happening on the bands right now.

🚀 **Try It Now**

Visit [dxlook.com](https://dxlook.com/), select Realtime from the view menu, and click Go — you’ll see HF propagation come alive within seconds.
