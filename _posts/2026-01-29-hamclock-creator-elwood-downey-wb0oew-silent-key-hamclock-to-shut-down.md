A [message](https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock/) posted to the [HamClock website](https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock/) earlier today announced that the HamClock project will no longer receive updates. The message stated that while the project has ended, HamClock devices should continue to operate until June 2026, at which point it's expected data will no longer be pushed to the application.

HamClock is a popular cross-platform application that visualizes a range of customizable data helpful to ham radio operators. As of 2023, HamClock was installed on more than 2,600 devices across the globe.

> HamClock is a kiosk-style application that provides real time space weather, radio propagation models, operating events and other information particularly useful to the radio amateur.

[Amateur Radio Daily](https://daily.hamweekly.com/) reached out to the creator and maintainer of HamClock, Elwood Downey (WB0OEW), via his personal email address and received an auto-reply message stating that Mr. Downey had become a silent key on January 29th, 2026.
