The New England area is experiencing enhanced tropospheric propagation issues due to the thick layer of smoke in the atmosphere from Nova Scotia wildfires.

> ...The smoke is causing radio waves to bounce back to the ground instead of beaming out to space. That, combined with temperature inversion (warmer air trapped above cooler air) helps the radio waves bounce hundreds of miles. [It occurred] this morning outside the News 12 Long Island studios in Bethpage, New York, where Long Island's radio station WBLI was replaced by Rumba 106.1 Philadelphia.
