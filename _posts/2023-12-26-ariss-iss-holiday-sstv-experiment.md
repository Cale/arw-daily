[Amateur Radio on the International Space Station](https://www.ariss.org/) (ARISS) has announced a special SSTV event taking place December 26th through 30th. This unique event will utilize the ISS voice repeater, relying on ground stations across Europe, Australia, and the United States to relay SSTV images. The images will be transmitted on 437.800 MHz. Receiving stations should take the [Doppler effect](https://mastodon.hams.social/@ARISS_Intl/111649450075918434) into consideration during these passes.

Additional information, including ISS pass times for various locations are [available on the ARISS social media feed on Mastodon](https://mastodon.hams.social/@ARISS_Intl).
