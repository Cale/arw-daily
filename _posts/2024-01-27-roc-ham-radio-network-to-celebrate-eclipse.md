From ROC-HAM Radio Network: 

Join us on April 8th as we celebrate the solar eclipse.

The [ROC-HAM Radio Network](https://www.roc-ham.net/) has secured the special event call **W2E** where we will be putting this special event marking this historic solar eclipse, especially since the next one is in 2033.

Check out the [ROC-HAM website for more info](https://www.roc-ham.net/solar-eclipse-2024/) on this wonderful event.

On Monday, April 8, 2024, total solar eclipse will cross North America, passing over Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The total solar eclipse will begin over the South Pacific Ocean. Weather permitting, the first location in continental North America that will experience totality is Mexicoâ€™s Pacific coast at around 11:07 a.m. PDT.

The path of the eclipse continues from Mexico, entering the United States in Texas, and traveling through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Small parts of Tennessee and Michigan will also experience the total solar eclipse. 

The eclipse will enter Canada in Southern Ontario, and continue through Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton. The eclipse will exit continental North America on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland, Canada, at 5:16 p.m. NDT.
