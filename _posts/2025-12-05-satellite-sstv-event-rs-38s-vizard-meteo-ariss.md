[ARISS](https://www.ariss.org/) has [announced](https://mastodon.hams.social/@ARISS_Intl/115655661664340760) an SSTV event that will be active through December 13th. Rather than transmitting images via the International Space Station, this event's SSTV images will transmit from the RS-38S satellite, also known as VIZARD-meteo.

Images will utilize the Robot 36 SSTV mode and transmit on 437.825 MHz. The series will contain 12 different images and run from December 4th through December 13th. 

Certificates will be available from the [ARISS website](https://ariss-usa.org/ARISS_SSTV/).

[RS-38S](https://db.satnogs.org/satellite/OYGZ-5054-3166-8092-6448) is a 3U CubeSat created in part by students in Russia and was launched in 2023.
