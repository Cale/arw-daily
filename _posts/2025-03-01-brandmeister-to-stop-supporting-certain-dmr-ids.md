Beginning this summer, the [Brandmeister DMR network](https://news.brandmeister.network/) will [no longer support](https://news.brandmeister.network/important-message-for-brandmeister-usa-hams-using-a-radio-id-starting-with-1/) certain devices with DMR IDs that begin with the number 1. Hams utilizing the Brandmeister network with affected DMR IDs are encouraged to request a new ID from [RadioID](https://radioid.net/). Brandmeister is requiring their users to obtain DMR IDs that adhere to a [Mobile Country Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code) (MMC) standard to help facilitate automated process that make up the Brandmeister network.

5-digit CAP+ IDs will stop working June 1st. 7-digit personal radio IDs starting with 1 will stop working January 1, 2026. Repeaters with 6-digit radio IDs starting with 1 will continue to work indefinitely.
