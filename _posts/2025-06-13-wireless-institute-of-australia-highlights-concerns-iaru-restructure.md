The [Wireless Institute of Australia](https://www.wia.org.au/) (WIA) released a [statement](https://www.wia.org.au/newsevents/news/2025/20250608-1/index.php) earlier this week highlighting concerns regarding the proposal to restructure the [IARU](https://www.iaru.org/) into a single entity. While WIA acknowledged many benefits to the proposed changes, there were several areas WIA considered drawbacks. Concerns included potential risk of regional underrepresentation, financial implications, and increased administration requirements. 

WIA also voiced proposed remedies to their concerns including regional specific advisory groups, flexible fee structures, and safeguards around virtual participation, among others. 

> The WIA remains committed to the mission and success of the IARU. However, unless and until our concerns are addresses in detail we are not in favour of the proposal as it is currently presented.
