[Ohio NVIS Day](https://arrl-ohio.org/SEC/nvis_day.html) takes place April 27th from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern. 

> The purpose of NVIS day is to construct and try various antenna ideas, all working as NVIS (Near Vertical Incident Skywave) antennas. These antennas are low to the ground and provide coverage generally within a 400 mile radius- extremely important for regional HF communications in an emergency.
