Designed by radio amateurs, [AO-7](https://www.amsat.org/two-way-satellites/ao-7/) launched in November of 1974 and is now [marking 50 years in orbit](https://www.amsat.org/ans-308-amsat-news-service-weekly-bulletins/). The satellite initially functioned for 6.5 years before its batteries failed. 21 years later AO-7 became operational again.

> A very active user of AO-7, Pat Gowain, G3IOR, from the UK, made a telephone call to Perry Klein, W3PK, (first AMSAT President and designer of the VHF/HF transponder). This was on June 21, 2002. Pat wondered if we had launched a new LEO spacecraft? He was hearing Morse Code Telemetry again on the old beacon frequency of AO-7. He played Perry a tape recording. It sure sounded like AO-7 telemetry!

AMSAT News Service will honor AO-7 over the next 3 weeks by publishing articles and stories to a [special page on the AMSAT website](https://www.amsat.org/amsat-ao-7-a-fifty-year-anniversary/).
