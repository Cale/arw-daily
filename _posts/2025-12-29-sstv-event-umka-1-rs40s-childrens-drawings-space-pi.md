[AMSAT-Francophone](https://site.amsat-f.org/) has posted information about an [SSTV event](https://site.amsat-f.org/2025/12/28/umka-1-rs40s-emission-sstv-du-28-au-de-janvier-2026/) sponsored by [Space-π](https://en.spacepi.space/). The event will transmit SSTV images from the [UmKA-1](https://en.spacepi.space/satellites/um-ka-1/) (RS40S) CubeSat and run December 28th through the later portion of January. Transmitted images will include children's drawings with additional imagery to follow early in January. 

Those looking to receive images can point their antennas at the UmKA-1 (RS40S) CubeSat and tune their receivers to 437.625 MHz. SSTV images are expected to be transmitted in the Robot 36 format.
