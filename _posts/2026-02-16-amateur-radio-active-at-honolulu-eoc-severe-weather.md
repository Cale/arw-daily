*The following is a message from the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management:*

**February 8–9, 2026 | Honolulu, Hawaiʻi**

On February 8–9, 2026, [severe weather brought high winds, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, power outages, and hazardous surf conditions across Honolulu and the State of Hawaiʻi](https://www.kitv.com/news/local/statewide-closures-in-hawaii-due-to-severe-weather-threat/article_62c2653b-1e92-4ca6-9e64-45d738da4929.html). Both [Governor Josh Green](https://www.instagram.com/p/DUg1nKKk0KH/) and Honolulu [Mayor Rick Blangiardi](https://www.honolulu.gov/mayor/mayor-issues-emergency-proclamation-shutters-non-essential-city-services-through-monday/) issued emergency proclamations to mobilize resources and protect public safety.

Amateur radio operators were activated inside the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in support of the [Department of Emergency Management (DEM), City and County of Honolulu.](https://www.honolulu.gov/dem/) Volunteer communicators reported in and stood ready to provide backup communications should cellular or internet systems fail.

### **During the activation, we:**

* Participated in county and statewide briefings with Governor Josh Green and Maj. Gen. Stephen Logan and [Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA)](https://dod.hawaii.gov/hiema/) leadership.  
* Joined statewide HF nets at 9:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m. on 7.090 MHz (LSB).  
* Updated and posted the ICS-205 Communications Plan on [HawaiiARES.net](http://HawaiiARES.net) for download and offline reference.  
* Logged activity in the ICS-214 Unit Log.  
* Operated at [KH6OCD](https://www.qrz.com/db/KH6OCD) on HF and VHF/UHF voice, monitored repeaters, and utilized [Winlink radio email](https://winlink.org/) on HF and VHF FM.

Radio traffic remained light as outages were quickly addressed through coordinated efforts between city and state agencies and utility partners. Shelters and volunteers remained ready in case conditions worsened.

## **Emergency Management Reserve Corps (EMRC)**

The [Emergency Management Reserve Corps (EMRC)](https://www.honolulu.gov/dem/get-involved/) supports the community through trained volunteers who serve either in field operations across Oʻahu or as amateur radio communicators under RACES. Most RACES members are also active in ARES, strengthening coordination between county and statewide response efforts. Interested operators on Oʻahu can apply here: [https://veoci.com/v/p/191705/workflow/7pgrj5u5q833](https://veoci.com/v/p/191705/workflow/7pgrj5u5q833)

*“It was encouraging to work alongside such engaged and supportive leadership from the Department. Dr. Randal Collins, Director, and Jennifer Walter, Deputy Director, along with Douglas Tom and Jeff Spencer, clearly understand how amateur radio strengthens resiliency and provides independent communications capability. Their awareness of our role in a larger grey or black sky event ensures RACES remains fully integrated into emergency operations.”*

— Michael Miller, KH6ML Deputy Coordinator, RACES Program

## **Operations and Coordination**

Mark Kaku, KH6LT, coordinated amateur radio operations inside the EOC, ensuring continuous coverage throughout the activation.

*“Our goal is simple—be ready before we’re needed. We focus on coverage, documentation, and coordination so that if primary systems fail, we can immediately step in.”*  
*— Mark Kaku, KH6LT Coordinator, RACES Program*

## **Prepared and Ready**

Systems were tested, nets were active, and documentation was completed. The activation reinforced the value of having trained, infrastructure-independent amateur radio communicators embedded within emergency management operations.

Mahalo to all who staffed the EOC and supported from across the islands.
