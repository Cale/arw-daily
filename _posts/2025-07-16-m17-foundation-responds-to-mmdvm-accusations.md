The [M17 Foundation](https://m17foundation.org/) has [responded](https://m17foundation.org/2025/07/15/m17-foundation-rebuttal-to-jonathan-naylor-g4klx-statements-regarding-m17/) to a number of grievances and rumors [expressed](https://groups.io/g/OpenDV/topic/removal_of_m17_from_the_mmdvm/114117206) by Jonathan Naylor (G4KLX), the maintainer of the MMDVM project. Along with dropping M17 support from the MMDVM project earlier this week, G4KLX posted statements critical of the M17 Project's management and technical implementation. 

The response from M17 is a point-by-point rebuttal of G4KLX's statements. 

With M17 support removed from MMDVM, amateur radio operators potentially lose access to the M17 digital voice mode via hotspots and repeaters.

The [M17 Project](https://m17project.org/) is an open source digital voice and data protocol that is positioned as an alternative to digital modes that require use of proprietary encoders.

[MMDVM](https://mmdvm.com/) is an open source project that enables amateur radio hotspots to support multiple digital voice modes including D-STAR, DMR, YSF, P25, NXDN, and POCSAG.
