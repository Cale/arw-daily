[HamSCI](https://www.hamsci.org/)'s first Speaker Series of 2026 will be presented by Dr. Barry Johnson (W4WB) and focus on WSPR spectral width.

> [W4WB] will be speaking on a paper he co-authored along with Gene Marcus, W3PM titled “A Modest Study of WSPR-2 Spectral Width”. The topic arose from a question posed originally by HamSCI scientist Gwyn Griffith G3ZIL which was, “What is the minimum obtainable spectral width of WSPR-2 signals?” To answer this seemingly simple question was anything but simple as will become evident in the discussion comprising this presentation.

The presentation will take place on January 8th at 21:00 UTC over Zoom. Those interested in joining can do so from [this Zoom link](https://scranton.zoom.us/j/286316405?pwd=QWdwMlFPbDlYeXg5ZDg1dmYzeFdCUT09).
