Toward the [100th Anniversary of JARL](https://www.jarl.org/English/8_info/100thAnniversary.html) and the 100th Anniversary of Amateur Radio in Japan

“The 100th Anniversary of Amateur Radio in Japan” commemorative logo and message established.

On June 12th, 1926, “Japan Amateur Radio League” was established by 37 members and they sent out the message notifying the establishment to the amateurs worldwide as given below.

“We have the honor of informing that we amateurs in Japan have organized today the Japanese Amateur Radio League. Please QST to all stations.”

In September next year, 1927, the shortwave radio telegraph and telephone experimental station “JXAX” was licensed. This is considered the first amateur radio station in Japan.

Therefore, it will be the 100th Anniversary of JARL in June 2026 and the 100th Anniversary of amateur radio in Japan in September 2027. JARL have decided to celebrate two anniversaries for whole bridging period of 16 months. JARL is not intend to celebrate alone, but invite the radio equipment manufacturers, relevant organizations and radio amateurs nationwide to join the celebration of these important events.

However, the goal is not just to look back and celebrate, but to make this a new starting point towards the future of irreplaceable culture called “Amateur Radio”.

Various commemorative events are planned during the celebration period and the logo of “100th Anniversary of Amateur Radio in Japan” is established in addition to already announced “100th Anniversary of JARL” logo.

“Because ‘normal’ is just boring.” This sentence expresses our sincere wish to share the charm of amateur radio which has fascinated us, with new radio amateurs coming into the world of amateur radio.

In the past up to now, many fore runners developed amateur radio without bound by common sense and with inquisitive mind and ingenuity. From now towards the future, we will also doubt the common sense and challenge with free inspiration.

We will continue to cherish these “Amateur Radio spirits”
