[RandomGram](https://groups.io/g/RandomGram), A unique CW contest, takes place December 20th. The contest is unique in that participants send random groups of characters designed to test the accuracy of exchanged information. Transmitting isn't required! Listeners may earn points by submitting groups of characters heard sent to other participants. 

The event begins December 20th at 22:00 UTC and runs for two hours.
