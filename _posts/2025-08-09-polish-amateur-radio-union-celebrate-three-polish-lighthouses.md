*From the Polish Amateur Radio Union:*

The Board of the Pomeranian Field Division of the [Polish Amateur Radio Union](https://ot09.pzk.org.pl/) (PZK) in Gdańsk invites all amateur radio operators to participate in a radio award ceremony to celebrate the anniversaries of the three Polish lighthouses: The 150th anniversary of the Czołpino (1875-2025), the 150th anniversary of the Rozewie II (or New) Lighthouses (1875-2025), and the 130th anniversary of the Krynica Morska Lighthouse (1895-2025).

The nine-day radio event runs from August 9th to 17th, 2025. For contacts made with the three event commemorative stations of the event organizer, each correspondent will receive a commemorative eAward. The regulations for the anniversary award ceremony, including the eAward graphic design and QSL card templates, are presented on our web page and qrz.com:
