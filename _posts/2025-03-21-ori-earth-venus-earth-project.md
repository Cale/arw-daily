[Open Research Institute](https://openresearch.institute/) (ORI) has begun an ambitious effort to bounce radio signals off Venus and back to Earth. A [project plan](https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/documents/blob/master/Engineering/Link_Budget/Link_Budget_Modeling.ipynb) is in place that outlines feasibility, requirements, and timing. 

> We've shown that with access to some of the largest amateur dishes, such as at DSES, Dwingeloo, Stockert, and potentially other sites, that amateur radio equipment and techniques can potentially bounce signals off Venus.

Hams are encouraged to [participate](https://openresearch.institute/getting-started) in the project.
