The [MORE Project](https://n2re.org/m-o-r-e-project) is providing free access to US amateur radio courses and licensing for youth aged 12-17. The project aims to license 500 hams by June 2026.

> The Make Operating Radio Easier (MORE) Project is an initiative to reduce both gender and age imbalances in Amateur (Ham) Radio, through education and hands-on activities. 

Training courses are administered during 2.5 hour sessions, once per week over 6 weeks. Participants completing the course and receiving their ham radio license will also receive a free handled transceiver. 

Those interested in signing up can review the [MORE Project page](https://n2re.org/m-o-r-e-project) for instructions on how to get started.
