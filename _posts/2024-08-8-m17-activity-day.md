[M17 Activity Day](https://m17project.org/get-started/m17-activity-day) is a weekly net that encourages hams to get on the air with the M17 digital voice mode. 

Internet users can join Reflector M17-M17 module C.

Additional methods to getting on the air including compatible HTs, hotspots, and software such as [mvoice](https://github.com/n7tae/mvoice) can be found on the [M17 Activity Day](https://m17project.org/get-started/m17-activity-day) website.
