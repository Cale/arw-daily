The installation of new equipment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to reenable HamTV appears to be successful. [ARISS](https://www.ariss.org/) [reports on Mastodon](https://mastodon.hams.social/@ARISS_Intl/114937694234424338) that ground stations over Europe had successfully received the HamTV carrier signal on July 29th. Carrier transmissions are expected to continue over the next few days. Additional reports are expected from North American hams.

Documentation on receiving HamTV from the ISS is [available from The British Amateur Television Club](https://wiki.batc.org.uk/HAMTV_from_the_ISS) (BATV). ARISS provides a [live feed of video](https://live.ariss.org/hamtv/) when the ISS is in range of HamTV receiver stations.
