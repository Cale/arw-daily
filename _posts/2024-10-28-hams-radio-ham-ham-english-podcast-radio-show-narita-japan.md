*[Ham's Radio](https://hamsradio.net/ham/)* is a weekly radio broadcast and podcast that highlights ham radio stories from across the globe. The radio broadcasts originate from Radio Narita outside of Tokyo, Japan. 83.7 FM is a community radio station, equivalent to a low power FM station ([LPFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-power_broadcasting)) found in the US.

Every first Sunday features a *Ham Ham English* segment in which an article is discussed in English to help listeners get more familiar with the English language. The [most recent episode](https://hamsradio.net/ham/?p=12651) features Keith Mowell (KE4KDY) who was in town for [Ham Fair](https://www.jarl.org/English/4_Library/A-4-6_ham-fair/Ham%20Fair%202024,%20Tokyo.html). He has experience operating from the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba. A version of the page translated to English is available [here](https://hamsradio-net.translate.goog/ham/?p=12588&_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc).
