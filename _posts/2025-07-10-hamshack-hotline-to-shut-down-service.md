[Hamshack Hotline](https://hamshackhotline.com/) has [announced](https://hamshackhotline.com/) its decision to end voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service effective August 29th, 2025. Established in 2018, the VoIP provider has enabled thousands of hams to connect across the globe. The workload required to maintain the service was cited as a reason for shutting down.

> ...with success came scale—and with scale, came increasing demands. As the network grew, so did the workload on our small team. Balancing this effort with our responsibilities to family, careers, and life outside the shack has become increasingly challenging. We’ve always taken great pride in the reliability and service standards of Hamshack Hotline, and we recognize that we can no longer maintain those standards at the level our users deserve.
