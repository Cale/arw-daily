General Class and above license holders in the United States will soon [have access](https://www.arrl.org/news/view/fcc-allocates-60-meter-world-wide-amateur-band-approved-at-wrc-15-continues-amateur-use-of-four-addi) to an expanded portion of the 60 Meter band. 

> Specifically, the Commission allocated 5351.5 - 5366.5 kHz (60 meters) to the amateur service on a secondary basis with a permitted power of 9.15 watts ERP. The Commission also authorized amateurs to continue using four existing channels outside of the 5351.5 - 5366.5 kHz band centered on 5332, 5348, 5373, and 5405 kHz on a secondary basis with a permitted power of 100 watts ERP.

This new allocation is in line with the regulations adopted during the 2015 World Radiocommunication Conference.
