> ...NASA launched a new app to make it easier than ever to spot the International Space Station in the night sky. NASA has long operated the [Spot the Station website](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/), but its new app, available on both iPhone and Android, brings augmented reality features and a handy interface to learn more about the orbiting laboratory. Find the app at the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spot-the-station/id6449235044) or at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nasa.hq.SpotTheStation).

The app will send notifications each time the station passes over your location, both day and night. A great utility reminder to jump on the APRS or voice repeater.
