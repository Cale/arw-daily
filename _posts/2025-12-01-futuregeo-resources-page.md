Amateur Radio Daily has compiled a [futureGEO resources page](https://daily.hamweekly.com/futuregeo/) to further promote the geostationary satellite project. The centralized resource is designed to make it easy for interested hams to learn more about the project. Currently, the resource page provides links to presentations, proposals, articles, and other relevant content. Additional information will be linked as it becomes available.

futureGEO is a proposed geostationary amateur radio satellite that is projected to provide coverage across significant portions of Europe and North America. The project is being spearheaded by the European Space Agency and [AMSAT Germany](https://amsat-dl.org/en/). The initial proposals mimic payloads similar to that of QO-100 but may include additional technology such as SDR and laser based communication experiments.
