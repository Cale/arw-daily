The [13 Colonies Special Event](http://13colonies.us/) returns for 2024 and will take place July 1-7. 13 special callsigns will be on the air, each one representing one of the original 13 British colonies that were [first established in 1607](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies). Three additional bonus callsigns will be on the air representing Great Britain, France, and Philadelphia.

Certificates will be available whether you work one or all colonies. The bonus stations are not required to earn a clean sweep. 

More information is available on the [13 Colonies Special Event website](http://13colonies.us/).
