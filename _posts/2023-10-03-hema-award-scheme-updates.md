The [HEMA](http://www.hema.org.uk/) Summit award scheme is slowly expanding with Cyprus, East Malaysia and West Malaysia being added to it and the first activations occurring from these regions in the last few months. 

There's been the first World HEMA Day on September 1st/2nd. There was a good response and all certificates have been sent out. Congratulations to Bill M0DXT and David M0YDH as joint top scorers. It looks like it will be run again around the same time next year.

A Smartphone App for Android smartphones "HEMA Assistant" is in the testing phase and spotting and listing spots with the app are working. Other features are still under development.
