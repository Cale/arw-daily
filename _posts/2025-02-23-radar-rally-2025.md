## Go ahead, try RaDAR!

Do you love the outdoors, Parks On The Air? I have a challenge for you, RaDAR.

RaDAR is Rapid Deployment Amateur Radio. Eddie Leighton ZS6BNE conceived the RaDAR concept in South Africa. You may have heard of the RaDAR Challenge. The [RaDAR Rally](https://www.radarrally.info) is the same idea, with some tweaks to the rules. 

The RaDAR Rally is a four-hour on-the-air event that tests your ham knowledge, portable equipment, and physical skills. Its for-hour duration creates an urgency that demands optimized equipment and operating strategies. The RaDAR Rally is on the first Saturdays of April and November. Choose four hours during the UTC day. The following Sunday is a backup date if Saturday is unfavorable for you. You may choose any outdoor venue where you can operate legally and safely. Parks are a natural choice. Make it as scenic as you can. You may combine RaDAR Rally with Parks on the Air, POTA or Summits On The Air, SOTA, 

Arrive at your first deployment, make at least five contacts, and move to the next deployment. Repeat as many times as possible for four hours. You can walk, canoe, bicycle, or use a motorized vehicle between deployments. The distances are at least one kilometer for walking or canoeing, two kilometers for bicycling, and six kilometers for a motorized vehicle. You can combine modes of movement during a Rally as you desire. You can also reuse a deployment location. The last deployment must have at least one contact. Research your venue. Choose the rig, antennas, and conveyances to optimize your score. Use practice deployments to build your skills and evaluate your gear. Remember to pack items for your comfort and safety.
 
All amateur bands and modes are allowed except terrestrial repeaters. You may work a station on multiple bands/modes at a deployment location and work them again on another deployment. You can use any means to spot your activity. The exchange varies with the situation. When calling CQ RaDAR, Exchange signal report, and location. Answering a CQ: Use the exchange for their activity. For RaDAR to RaDAR contacts, exchange signal report and an eight-digit grid square. 

RaDAR operators appreciate ham friends who help them get those five contacts required to move. Since RaDAR ops bounce between operating and moving, often with low power and compromise antennas, they are like rare DX. Please chase them. 

The QSO points earned are three for RaDAR-to-RADAR contacts, two for POTA or SOTA contacts, and one for all other stations. The final score equals the total QSO points times the number of deployments plus bonus points. There are three bonus points for each non-motorized transition and five bonus points when all contacts are QRP. 

Registration starts one month before the event. The RaDAR Rally rules are at [www.radarrally.info](https://www.radarrally.info). You can also subscribe to the RaDAR Group at [https://groups.io/g/RaDAR](https://groups.io/g/RaDAR). 

Please prepare for the next RaDAR Rally coming up on April 5th, 2025. Read the rules. Evaluate your gear, techniques, and strategy. Practice deploying and moving. Make your plan and register. Enjoy the event. Submit your summary and share your experience on social media. This completes my pitch for the RaDAR Rally.
