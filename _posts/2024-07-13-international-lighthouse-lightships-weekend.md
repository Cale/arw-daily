[International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend](https://www.lighthouse-weekend.international/) (ILLW) runs for 48 hours from 00:01 UTC August 17th to 24:00 UTC August 18th 2024. Participants can expect around 500 entities to be on the air across 40 different countries.

ILLW is not a traditional contest in that there are no awards or certificates. Each station may choose their own bands, times, and power requirements.
