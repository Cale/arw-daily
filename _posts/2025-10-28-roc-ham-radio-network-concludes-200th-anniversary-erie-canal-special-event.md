ROC-HAM Radio network concludes the 200th anniversary of the ERIE CANAL special event station W2R

We recorded 2600 contacts, 29 activation's of US-6532 Erie Canalway Corridor National Heritage Area.

We gave away a certificate for the 1st 1000th contact - W8BDS and a certificate for the 2nd 2000th contact - W2VDZ. Thank you for your support.

The special event station ran from Sept 1st - Oct 26, which incidentally is the official finish date of the ERIE CANAL.

While W2JLD endured the in climate weather in Rochester, NY, he did manage to achieve a record for the most contacts in one single day, he clocked in more than 100 hours of radio time.

It was a great pleasure to promote that special event and to inform people of the historic relevance of that Canal system and the importance of it in the date of time.

It shaped communities and the way we transported goods and services, people struggled during its building. Lives were shaped by its construction. It was a huge endeavor of its kind, and thanks to the vision of the then governor Clinton, he took a risk and knew it would be a huge benefit to the towns and cities along the way.

Here in upstate New York we cherish the history and significance of it. 

Again Thank you to all that supported this special event and be sure to check out the qrz page:[W2R](https://www.qrz.com/db/W2R) and grab a qsl card to boldly display it in your ham shack.

On behalf of the ROC-HAM Radio network THANK YOU
