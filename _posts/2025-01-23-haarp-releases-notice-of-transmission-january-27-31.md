*The following press release was received from the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP):*

Date: January 21, 2025   
To: Amateur Radio & Radio Astronomy Communities   
From: HAARP Program Office   
Subject: Notice of Transmission   

The [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/) (HAARP) will be conducting a research campaign January 27-31 UTC, with operating times specified in the table below. Operating frequencies will vary, but all HAARP transmissions will be between 2.75 MHz and 10 MHz. Actual transmit days and times are highly variable based on real-time ionospheric and/or geomagnetic conditions. All information is subject to change.

This campaign is being conducted in support of research proposals from UAF, the University of Florida, the Naval Research Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and the University of Houston. Research topics for this campaign include VLF generation and ducting, studies on STEVE airglow, and space debris detection. This campaign will also support the GIRAFF rocket launch from Poker Flat Research Range, which is investigating the mechanisms that cause flickering and pulsing within the aurora. More information on GIRAFF is available here: [https://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story301-36.380%20381%20GIRAFF.html](https://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story301-36.380%20381%20GIRAFF.html)

Note that a number of experiments will be conducted based on the critical frequency (f<sub>0</sub>F2) determined by the Gakona ionosonde. The included transmission notice supplement contains information on the frequencies HAARP is authorized to transmit. HAARP transmissions will only occur on our authorized frequencies. There are no specific data collection requests from funded investigators, but reception reports are appreciated and may be submitted online via our web form at: [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/form/reception-reports](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/form/reception-reports)

For updates on ionospheric conditions in Gakona, including f<sub>0</sub>F2, please consult ionograms from the HAARP Diagnostic Suite: [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/diagnostic-suite](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/diagnostic-suite)
