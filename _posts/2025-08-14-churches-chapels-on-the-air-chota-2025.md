[Churches & Chapels On The Air](https://wacral.org/chota/) encourages ham radio operators to active local churches on September 13, 2025. The event [originated](https://wacral.org/chota-history/) in 2006 in the United Kingdom as a way to bring awareness to a local fundraising event. In 2024, 54 stations were on the air across the globe.
