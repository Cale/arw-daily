In a [recent issue](https://arrl.informz.net/informzdataservice/onlineversion/ind/bWFpbGluZ2luc3RhbmNlaWQ9MzIwMzQxNSZzdWJzY3JpYmVyaWQ9NTI4ODg4ODI3#Bookmark_A4402782A) of the [NTS Letter](https://www.arrl.org/nts-letter), the ARRL encouraged amateur radio operators to utilize the [Radiogram portal on the web](https://nts2.arrl.org/radiogram/) to submit messages to friends and family.

While plenty of NTS volunteers are standing by ready to relay Radiograms, there's a need from hams to send messages:

> We have had approximately 70 applicants authorized to become “radiogrammers” and we are very grateful for their offers of help, but they would really benefit from more messages to generate and relay.

Sending Radiograms helps volunteers hone their skills in preparation for emergencies.
