In addition to [agenda items](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2023/10/24/november-2023-open-meeting-agenda) focusing on increasing access to broadband internet, empowering survivors of domestic violence, and implications of artificial intelligence as it relates to robocalls and robotexts, the FCC also called out amateur radio as an agenda item for its upcoming November Open Meeting: 

> **Weâ€™re bolstering amateur radio.** We will vote on a proposal to incentivize innovation and experimentation in the amateur radio bands by removing outdated restrictions and providing licensees with the flexibility to use modern digital emissions.

"Outdated restrictions" likely refers to recent discussion and [proposed legislation](http://www.arrl.org/news/view/rep-lesko-introduces-bill-to-replace-symbol-rate-limit-with-bandwidth-limit) to repeal HF digital symbol rate limits.
