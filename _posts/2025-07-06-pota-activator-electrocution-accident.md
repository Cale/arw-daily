Tripp Owens (N4NTO) is [believed](https://abc11.com/post/man-found-dead-apparent-electrocution-harnett-county-cemetery/16956192/) to have been electrocuted while working with an antenna mast during a [Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/) (POTA) activation in North Carolina. N4NTO was an avid participant with POTA [activating over 660 parks](https://pota.app/#/profile/N4NTO).

> [N4NTO] was a great CW op, and I had many POTA QSOs with him. His death is a reminder that even if you have over 600 activations under your belt, you always need to be alert for power lines when putting up and taking down portable antennas. &mdash;&nbsp;[VA2NW](https://mastodon.radio/@va2nw/114801452027386976)

[QRPer called for a renewed look at safety](https://qrper.com/2025/07/a-tragic-reminder-safety-must-come-first-in-the-field/) in the field:

> Letâ€™s honor Tripp by taking antenna safety seriously and helping others do the same. Share reminders. Watch out for one another. Stay mindful in the field.
