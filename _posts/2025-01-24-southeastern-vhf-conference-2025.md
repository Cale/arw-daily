PowerPoint (.ppt or .pptx) format and delivered at the conference on a USB memory
stick. Please understand that your PowerPoint Slide presentation will not be accepted to

**Printing:**   
We print what we receive. We do not copy edit (but will correct something if we notice it – or if you notice it and let us know). We try to make all papers somewhat uniform, but we do not rework each article. Page numbers are added as we prepare the files for our printer.
