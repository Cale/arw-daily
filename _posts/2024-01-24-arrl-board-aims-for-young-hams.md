In an effort to engage young hams, the [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/) board has [approved](http://www.arrl.org/member-bulletin?issue=2024-01-21) two new initiatives. Full-time students aged 21 and younger are now eligible for a free membership. ARRL will also establish a Student Coding Competition in which students aged 21 and under will design software applications with awards up to $25,000.

In addition to a focus on young hams, ARRL approved a number of other items, including:

- The reintroduction of ARRL Life Membership and 70+ Life Membership
- A goal of recruiting and developing greater participation in ARES
- Rebuke of efforts by the ad-hoc group "Shortwave Modernization Coalition"
