The [NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) once again [observed extreme G5 level geomagnetic storm conditions](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g5-conditions-reached-yet-again) on May 11th at 1128 UTC. Reports of GPS and HF communication disruption continue. Overnight, aurora was visible across much of the United States and Europe. Conditions may not subside until Sunday with potential for aurora to be visible again tonight at lower latitudes.

On the [NOAA Geomagnetic Storm scale](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation) which spans G1 through G5, G5 is considered the most extreme:

> **Power systems:** Widespread voltage control problems and protective system problems can occur, some grid systems may experience complete collapse or blackouts. Transformers may experience damage.   
**Spacecraft operations:** May experience extensive surface charging, problems with orientation, uplink/downlink and tracking satellites.   
**Other systems:** Pipeline currents can reach hundreds of amps, HF (high frequency) radio propagation may be impossible in many areas for one to two days, satellite navigation may be degraded for days, low-frequency radio navigation can be out for hours, and aurora has been seen as low as Florida and southern Texas (typically 40Â° geomagnetic lat.).
