It's been nearly a year since we've seen public mention of the amateur radio focused geosynchronous satellite project that was [proposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FTvlEyDa1Y) by the European Space Agency (ESA) back in late 2023. However, AMSAT-DL [recently sent](https://amsat-dl.org/en/rfei-for-futuregeo-project/) a Request for Expression of Interest (RFEI) to amateur radio associations, AMSAT organizations, and other experts.

> The aim is to identify potential partners who would like to actively participate in the definition and development of a new amateur radio payload for a future geostationary satellite. Contributions should include innovative technical ideas, experiences from previous missions (e.g. QO-100) as well as concrete proposals for payloads, experiments and educational initiatives.

AMSAT-DL is currently referring to the project as "futureGEO." A copy of the [RFEI request](https://amsat-dl.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMSAT-Organisations-futureGEO-RFEI.pdf) (PDF) is available. Feedback should be provided by June 30th, 2025.

In addition, the [AMSAT-CA](https://amsat-ca.org/) website [suggests](https://amsat-ca.org/2025/02/25/upcoming-event/) that AMSAT Canada has created a position paper to represent Canadian interests in futureGEO. The paper has not been published to the AMSAT-CA website. There's also no mention of when the paper was submitted or to which agency.

When asked about the project at the AMSAT booth at Hamvention, the representative I spoke with had no new information.

The ESA [proposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FTvlEyDa1Y) the idea of a geosynchronous satellite back in December of 2023 with proposals from [AMSAT-UK](https://daily.hamweekly.com/2023/12/geo-satellite-proposal-covers-north-america-lasers/) and [AMSAT-DL](https://daily.hamweekly.com/2024/03/amsat-dl-publishes-geo-satellite-proposal/) following in late 2023 and early 2024. The footprint of the satellite is expected to cover Europe and large portions of North America.
