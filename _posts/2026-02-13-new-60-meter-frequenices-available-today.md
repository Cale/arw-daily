The FCC [approved access](https://www.arrl.org/news/view/new-60-meter-frequencies-available-as-of-february-13) to a new set of 60 meter frequencies to be more in line with the worldwide 60 meter amateur allocation made by the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2015. US General and Extra class holders may now operate on a secondary basis between 5351.5 and 5366.5 kHz.

> The existing 60-meter channels centered on 5332, 5348, 5373, and 5405 kHz remain as secondary amateur allocations with maximum power of 100 watts ERP. However, the old channel at 5358.5 kHz is eliminated as it is now part of the new 5351.5-5366.5 kHz subband and subject to the lower power limit.

Additional rules including a maximum bandwidth of 2.8 kHz and maximum transmit power of 9.15 watts ERP apply.
