HamTV is [scheduled to be reinstalled](https://www.amsat.org/ans-208-amsat-news-service-weekly-bulletins/) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) July 29th. Test transmissions could occur the same day. 

> HamTV is a digital amateur television system developed for educational outreach, allowing students to see live video from space during school contacts with the ISS. The system transmits MPEG-2 video using the DVB-S protocol, with a downlink frequency of 2395 MHz.

HamTV was originally operational in 2013 but failed 6 years later in 2019. The [British Amateur Television Club](https://batc.org.uk/) (BATV) has [extensive documentation](https://wiki.batc.org.uk/HAMTV_from_the_ISS) related to HamTV, including how to receive the DVB-S protocol transmitting from the ISS.
