The [Radio Society of Great Britain](https://rsgb.org/main/) (RSGB) has provided an [update](https://rsgb.org/main/blog/news/rsgb-notices/2024/05/24/june-2024-strategic-priorities-update/) of their four strategic priorities which are designed to secure future success. The priorities are:

- Growth of amateur radio
- Membership of the RSGB
- Spectrum and licensing
- Continued financial stability of the Society

> Each will be championed by a Board Director. For example, Ben, GW4MNL is overseeing the creation of an outreach team that will put in place the building blocks to support individuals, clubs and RSGB volunteers to take amateur radio out to a variety of external audiences.

>Our membership priority will involve identification of active amateurs who are not members of the Society and sharing with them the many benefits of joining and adding their voice to ours. We also need to engage more with our membership to better understand their expectations and needs going forward.

> It is essential that each strategic goal and activity has clear means identified to measure success, and I will be working to ensure that these are put into place and to monitor and report on our progress.

> We need an all-encompassing strategy so that the volunteers and staff have a single direction and everyone knows where the Society is heading.
