The [German Amateur Radio Club](https://www.darc.de/) (DARC) will be hosting a [webinar](https://www.iaru-r1.org/2025/join-the-enams-global-monitoring-system-webinar/) demonstrating the [Electrical Noise Area Monitoring System](https://www.enams.de/) (ENAMS). ENAMS is designed to record the entirety of the HF spectrum in order to monitor background noise.

> The ENAMS 2.0 SDR receiver system is an improved version compared to ENAMS 1.0: Local storage of raw and calibrated data up to 5 years, i.e., stations are now easily relocatable and can be operated offline I/Q data are stored for a certain time and can be retrieved More computing power w/ additional Raspberry Pi. Very high reliability for 24/7 Operation.The system consists of an antenna, pre-amplifier, antenna mast, antenna cables and ENAMS 2.0 receiver.

The webinar will take Place February 13th at 1800 UTC over Zoom. Anyone interested in attending [may register here](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/hFtBLM3ZSt6xahoQ90QO2w).
