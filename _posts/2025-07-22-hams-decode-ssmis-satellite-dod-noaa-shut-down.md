[The Register](https://www.theregister.com/) [reports](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/ssmis_satellite_decoder) that [SatDump](https://www.satdump.org/) now features software which will decode data transmitted by the [Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSMIS) (SSMIS) onboard defense meteorological satellites. The release from SatDump comes after the US Department of Defense announced that data from the satellites would no longer be made available to the public.

> Lead developer and ham radio operator Alan Antoine said the US authorities were turning off the online distribution of real time data while the satellite passes over the US stations at Wallops Island, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska.

Access to the latest versions of SatDump are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump).
