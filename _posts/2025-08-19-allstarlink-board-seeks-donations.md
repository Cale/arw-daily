The [AllStarLink](https://www.allstarlink.org/) board of directors is seeking additional donations to help maintain the AllStarLink system. In an [email](https://contact.allstarlink.org/campaign/8228cb45-b27d-4788-8f98-4544206e458d/c287170f-03e8-4a01-a817-6b1bf2519b66) sent to AllStarLink users, the board noted a 400% increase in connected nodes over the past 4 years and called out operational expenses currently running at a deficit. A $12 per year per node donation was suggested. 

A call for volunteers was also communicated. AllStarLink is looking for software developers with experience in JavaScript, PHP, and Laravel.

> If you find value in the AllStarLink service, we are asking for a voluntary donation of $12/yr per node to help us maintain and improve the AllStarLink eco-system. For those wishing to support our ongoing efforts please see our 501(c)3 donations page at [AllStarLink | Donate](https://www.allstarlink.org/about/donate.php)
