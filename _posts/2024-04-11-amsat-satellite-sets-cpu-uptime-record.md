AMSAT's AO-109 (Fox-1E) CubeSat is scheduled to reenter Earth's atmosphere in the weeks ahead. The fifth generation Fox 1U CubeSat recently set a record for longest CPU uptime. Most Fox type satellites trigger system resets every few days or weeks while AO-109 has managed to operate continuously for over 18 million seconds or roughly 7 months since September 2023. 

AO-109 features a 30KHz linear transponder for amateur radio use. See more information on [AO-109's amateur radio capabilities](https://www.amsat.org/ao-109-radfxsat-2-amsat-fox-1e-open-for-amateur-use/).
