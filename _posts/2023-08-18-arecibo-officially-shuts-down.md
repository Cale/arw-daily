The Arecibo Observatory, which recently suffered catastrophic damage to its 305-meter telescope, has officially shut down all research efforts. 

Since the collapse of the main telescope in 2020, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) had intended to convert the facility into an educational research center, but [doubts have risen](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02503-x) whether that plan will pan out.
