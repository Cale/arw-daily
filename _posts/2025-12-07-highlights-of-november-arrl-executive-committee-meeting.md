The following are summaries and excerpts from the [minutes of the November 2025 ARRL Executive Committee Meeting](). The purpose of this post is to highlight in-progress items that ARRL might not normally promote through official channels, but hams might be interested in learning more about. Readers are encouraged to view the [entire document]() for additional context. 

Pass the Bill has generated significantly more activity compared to previous efforts to pass HOA/antenna related legislation. https://send-a-letter.org/hoa/ has seen over 44,000 sign-ups with the strongest support coming from Texas, California, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and Michigan. [Page 1,9,10]

Membership was at 130,240 for October. [Page 1]

ARRL has targeted 50,000 lapsed members with 1,500 people engaging. [Page 2]

It's believed the ARRL Sweepstakes has generated a 60% increase in Diamond Club membership. [Page 2]

The Collegiate Amateur Radio Program now features 40 participating universities, a record high participation rate. [Page 2]

ARRL has had success selling their end-fed half wave antenna and plan to offer additional antenna product. "Success" was not defined. [Page 3]

ARRL may create a coding competition which is expected to kick off in early 2026. It's expected participants must be less than 22 years of age. [Page 2,4]

Due to the decrease in participation in the ARRL Sweepstakes Contest since 1980, the contest may be shortened to accommodate younger operators who typically only operate for 6-8 hours within the current 24-48 hour contest period. [Pages 8,9]

**IARU Restructuring**   
It appears the IARU restructuring plan that made headlines earlier this year may not materialize as originally proposed. 

> ...after getting feedback from the regions, the Administrative Council announced that under a revised restructuring plan, the regional organizations would not be eliminated.

The previous proposal would have eliminated ARRL's power to nominate the IARU President and Vice President, leaving the task to the individual member societies. 

ARRL is expected to retain nomination authority, but consult with a new nomination committee made up of regional society members.

> As the International Secretariat, ARRL provides support to the International Amateur Radio Union through financial contributions and covering travel and administrative expenses within the six-figure range. With this financial support, ARRL retains the authority to select the president and vice president of the IARU. [Page 12,13]
