The [3916 Santa Net](https://www.cqsanta.com/) continues for the 16th year and will be active each evening now through Christmas Eve on 3.916 MHz at 7PM Central time. 

> Pete Thomson (KE5GGY), of The 3916 Nets, commented on The 3916 Santa Net. He said, "Christmastime is a very special time for our nets every year. We enjoy helping young people and their families have a shared Christmas experience that they'll always remember. And we're thrilled to introduce young people to the excitement of amateur radio."
