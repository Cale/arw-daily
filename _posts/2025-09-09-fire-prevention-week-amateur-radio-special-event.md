*The following is a message from VE3KGK:*

October 5th through October 11th, a special annual event will take place promoting fire safety during Fire Prevention Week, with the theme being Lithium-ion battery fire safety where we mention a safety tip with the contacts. 

The following stations usually participate: KF2IRE, N1F through N9F, and [VA3FIRE](https://www.qrz.com/db/VA3FIRE) from Ontario and a printable certificate is available from [hamfire.com](https://hamfire.com) where the event information is.

The lead station is N4F in Gainesville FL. VA3FIRE is a wildcard station that can help with earning that certificate. The various stations spot themselves on DX Summit and as it is not a contest stations can be found on most HF bands working SSB and some FT-8.
