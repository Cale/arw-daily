Today, HamSCI kicks off two events as part of the [HamSCI Festivals of Eclipse Ionospheric Science](https://www.hamsci.org/contest-info#Festivals). Hams are encouraged to transmit, receive, and record signals over HF which will then be used by researchers to study the effects of the ionosphere during the eclipse.

## Solar Eclipse QSO Party (SEQP)

> The SEQP is a typical ham radio contest for those who wish to makes tens, hundreds or even thousands of CW, SSB and digital mode QSOs on 160-6 meters during the 2023 and 2024 American solar eclipses.  Each QSO will become one of millions of data points which will help researchers answer science questions about ionospheric variability.

## Gladstone Signal Spotting Challenge (GSSC)

> The GSSC is a unique event for those who enjoy operating beacons (CW and digital), and the 'propagation study modes' of WSPR and FST4W, both transmit and receive.  Signals generated and received during the GSSC will help researchers answer science questions about ionospheric variability.
