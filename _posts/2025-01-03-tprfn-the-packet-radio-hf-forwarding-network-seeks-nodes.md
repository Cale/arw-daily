[The Packet Radio HF Forwarding Network](https://www.tprfn.net/) (TPRFN) is looking for additional network nodes to further build out a packet network that currently spans the east cost of the US from Maine to Florida.

> TPRFN is a network that links existing VHF/UHF packet networks, and stand-alone nodes, together using HF bands and newer digital modes. It primarily uses NVIS-range links for its consistent dependability.

TPRFN is currently looking to add nodes in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. See the [TPRFN website](https://www.tprfn.net/) for more information, including a [network map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1a2IGi69o4z2HjerNOrFO73Gj0VApFj4&ll=37.68586723999243%2C-78.51545850000002&z=5).
