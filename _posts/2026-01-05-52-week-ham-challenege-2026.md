The [52 Week Ham Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/) is back for 2026.

This year's challenge consists of weekly exercises ranging from making a QSO on Echolink to eliminating a source of interference.

> This is meant to inspire you to extend your horizon in amateur radio by weekly challenges through the year that touch all aspects of ham radio (and related fields). A lot of the challenges may be trivial for some participants (because it is what they do all the time), but very challenging to others. Participants of the challenge are encouraged to help each other in any way possible.

Participants are encouraged to post progress through social media using the #hamchallenge hashtag. An [IRC channel](https://web.libera.chat/#hamchallenge) is also available.

The 53 Week Ham Challenge is created by Fabian Kurz (DJ5CW).
