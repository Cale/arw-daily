[AMSAT-UK](https://amsat-uk.org/) will partner with Surrey NanoSystems and a number of universities including [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) to test a special black paint on an upcoming CubeSat deployment. When applied to a surface, the super black paint, [Vantablack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantablack), is designed to absorb 98% of light. The goal of the partnership is to demonstrate potential solutions to reducing light pollution as it relates to astronomy. 

> This high level of light absorption makes the coated surfaces appear extremely dark, helping to minimise the unwanted brightness from satellites that can disrupt the work of stargazers.

The [Jovian-1](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/universities-launch-pioneering-space-programme-boost-uk-skills-and-graduate-opportunities) CubeSat mission containing this experiment is scheduled to launch in 2026. More information will be available at the [AMSAT-UK Colloquium](https://amsat-uk.org/colloquium/) taking place in October.
