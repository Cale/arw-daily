[OpenSource.radio](https://opensource.radio/) is a new wiki started by DK1MI which aims to highlight all things open source in amateur radio. From hardware to software, this project is designed to provide hams with a free source of information to help further their exploration into the ham radio hobby. 

The [OpenSource.radio wiki can be viewed here](https://opensource.radio/). DK1MI is looking for additional contributors and has provided a [how-to document](http://opensource.radio/doku.php/howto_contribute) for those interested.

> [DK1MI created] a public Wiki that lists and describes available open source projects in more detail, as well as providing ready-made recipes for setting up a free amateur radio station. It should serve as a first port of call to find out what alternatives there are to commercial products or simply to get inspiration for new projects.
