[ARDC](https://www.ardc.net/) has awarded a second grant to the Internet Archive's [Digital Library of Amateur Radio and Communications](https://archive.org/details/dlarc?tab=about). The grant will allow DLARC to continue curating and preserving historical content related to ham radio for an additional two years. The library includes a plethora of content from club [newsletters](https://archive.org/details/dlarc-newsletters), to software, to old printed [callbooks](https://archive.org/details/callbook) that date back to the early 1900s.

DLARC has a [wantlist](https://archive.org/details/dlarc-wantlist). If you own copies of any of the publications sought by DLARC, please consider donating them for preservation and future amateur radio enthusiasts.

> Digital Library of Amateur Radio and Communications is a free online library devoted to ham radio, shortwave listening, college radio, and early communications. This free resource combines archived digitized print materials, born-digital content, websites, oral histories, personal collections, and other related records and publications. The goals of DLARC are both to document the history of amateur radio and to provide freely available educational resources for researchers, students, and the general public.
