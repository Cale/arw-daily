[ARISS](https://www.ariss.org/) will be conducting Expedition 72 - Series 21 SSTV Experiment from the International Space Station October 8th through 14th. Anyone with a receiver and SSTV decoding software can listen in on 145.800 MHz for SSTV images transmitted in mode PD120. The Service Module radio will be used along with the Russian callsign, RS0ISS. 

Decoded images may be sent to ARISS at [http://www.spaceflightsoftware.com/ARISS_SSTV/](http://www.spaceflightsoftware.com/ARISS_SSTV/)

Receiving images can be achieved with an HT and a smartphone running an SSTV app such as [Robot36](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xdsopl.robot36) or [SSTV Slow Scan TV](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sstv-slow-scan-tv/id387910013) by simply placing the HT near the smartphone's microphone.
