### SpottedHam.com Launches Real-Time Custom Keyword Alerts for Portable Operators

A new web-based tool for the amateur radio community, [SpottedHam.com](https://www.spottedham.com/), has launched to provide hams with a more granular way to monitor the bands. Unlike traditional clusters, SpottedHam allows users to create custom watchlists for specific callsigns, POTA (Parks on the Air) references, or specific bands and modes.

The system monitors live spotting data and sends an immediate email notification to the user the moment a match is found. This is particularly useful for operators chasing specific park references or monitoring the activity of friends and local club members.

Developer Robert Campbell/KM6HBH designed the tool to be mobile-first, ensuring that activators in the field and operators in the shack have a clean, clutter-free interface. The service is currently free to use and supports global spotting data, including UK and European POTA references.

Interested operators can find the live spotting table, an easy way to spot themselves, and sign up for alerts at: [https://www.spottedham.com](https://www.spottedham.com/)
