The [Personal Space Weather Station](https://hamsci.org/psws-overview) (PSWS) network is a distributed series of receivers designed to measure the space environment. These stations are built by professionals, citizen scientists, and ham radio operators.

> [HamSCI](https://hamsci.org/) and its partners are constantly at work on expanding the network,  improving the PSWS data collection hardware and software, growing the network infrastructure for data storage and retrieval, as well as meeting HamSCI's ultimate goal, analysis of the collected data.

HamSCI has [announced](https://forums.qrz.com/index.php?threads/hamsci-announces-expansion-of-personal-space-weather-station-activities.942624/) a recurring [series](https://hamsci.org/get-involved) of Zoom based sessions to help those interested in the project.
