The [IARU Monitoring System](https://www.iaru-r1.org/about-us/committees-and-working-groups/iarums/) has [released a log](https://www.iaru-r1.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IARUMS-R1-Newsletter-2024-11.pdf) with accompanying video of hundreds of examples of non-amateur transmissions taking place across the amateur radio HF bands during 2024.

Examples include DRM broadcasts from Communications University of China, [SuperDARN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dual_Auroral_Radar_Network) radars from across the globe, [CODAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_ocean_dynamics_applications_radar), British over-the-air-radar, as well as CBers and pirate radio operators.

> All these hundreds of non-amateur transmissions - the najority of them, long-lasting - are a a big annoyance for the amateur radio operators that try to enjoy their hobby in the bands that are allocated to them for that purpose, as they drastically reduce the usable spectrum in these bands.
