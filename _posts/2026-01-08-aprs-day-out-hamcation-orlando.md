> APRS Day Out is the [brain child of Bob Bruninga](http://www.aprs.org/APRS-day-out.html), WB4APR/sk. In his words "The purpose of the APRS Day out is to test our skills at forming ad-hoc networks in ham radio for use at events and disasters. 

Operators are encouraged to send messages and bulletins to spread information and connect with one another. More information is [available here](https://app.simplenote.com/publish/ygcJHq).
