Australian amateur radio operators have partnered with commercial networking experts, [KernWi-Fi](https://kernwifi.com.au/) to build an "enterprise-grade" network of linked repeaters. The network of repeaters utilizes Yaesu's Multi‑site Repeater System (IMRS) technology to route repeater traffic over a secure internet link. 

> Our goal was straightforward: deliver IMRS over an IP fabric that behaves like a carrier network—predictable routing, strong isolation, and security you can audit. If we treat community infrastructure with enterprise discipline, reliability follows. &mdash;Phil Kern (VK5PK)

Members of the [Darwin Amateur Radio Club](https://vk8da.au/) and the [South Pacific Contest Club](https://sppc.org.au/) were involved in this project. [Details of the build](https://kernwifi.com.au/kernwi-fi-engineers-the-vk-yaesu-imrs-network-a-first-of-its-kind-carrier-grade-build-for-australia/) are available on the KernWi-Fi website. A network diagram is also [available](https://kernwifi.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KernWi-Fi-AUS-Repeater-Net.pdf) (PDF).
