Amateur radio operators from surrounding areas will assemble at Halifax, North Carolina on April 11-13, 2024, to activate special event station N4C. They will operate several Ham stations, using voice, cw (morse code), and digital modes, to communicate with as many other hams, around the world, as possible. This activity is to commemorate the signing of The Halifax Resolves, which occurred on April 12, 1776.

The Halifax Resolves was the first written instrument, in existence, leading to US independence from England. It was approved unanimously at the Fourth Provincial Congress gathered at Halifax, NC. It authorized the NC delegates, being sent to the Continental Congress, to vote for, and encourage other colonyâ€™s delegates to support independence from England. This led to the US's Declaration of Independence being adopted and signed on July 4, 1776.

Hams around the world that make contact with this special event station, can request a QSL card confirming the contact, by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to:

Barry Evans, N4WFU   
P. O. Box 1533   
Roanoke Rapids, NC 27870

A certificate suitable for framing is also available for a donation of 5 US dollars to offset its cost. If possible, please include an address label if requesting the certificate.
