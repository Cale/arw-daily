> On Saturday, April 6, 2024, between 08:30 – 12:30, the [West Carleton Amateur Radio Club](https://wcarc.ca/) (WCARC) will be having a [Microwave Activity Day](https://wcarc.ca/mad.html) (MAD) on the grounds of the Diefenbunker: Canada’s Cold War Museum. The Diefenbunker is at grid square FN15xi.

> MADs are events when amateur radio operator microwave enthusiasts get out into the field and set up their portable stations to test, align, and hopefully establish two-way communications with other microwave aficionados. They offer an opportunity to amateurs who are curious about microwave operations to learn more. All are welcome. We hope to see you there!
