For readers of Amateur Radio Daily that regularly visit through a web browser, you'll notice an improved version of the solar conditions displayed in the header. In addition, readers will see a new section in the sidebar that communicates current HF band conditions.

These improvements are made possible thanks to a collaboration with [DXLook](https://dxlook.com/), the live propagation platform created by Rodrigo Vazquez (AK6FP).

The new data feed displays continuously updated Solar Flux Index (SFI), Sunspot Number, and A- and K-indices, along with current band-by-band propagation assessments. Together, these indicators give operators an at-a-glance view of the day’s radio conditions before they get on the air.

> DXLook is a community project built to share live propagation data freely with all amateurs. Partnering with Amateur Radio Daily brings that information to an even wider audience of active operators. &mdash;Rodrigo Vazquez (AK6FP) 

The update reflects the collaborative spirit of amateur radio—combining independent efforts to make space-weather awareness and HF propagation insights more accessible to everyone in the hobby.
