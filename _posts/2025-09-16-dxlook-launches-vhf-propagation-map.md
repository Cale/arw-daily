*The following is a press release from [DXLook](https://dxlook.com/):*

September 2025 — DXLook is proud to announce the launch of [vhf.dxlook.com](https://vhf.dxlook.com/), a brand-new platform dedicated to real-time visualization of VHF propagation activity.

The VHF map provides radio amateurs with an easy way to see where signals are being heard, using live APRS-IS data to display paths, hops, and coverage contours. Stations appear dynamically on the map, and their reception footprints are grouped into distance-based lobes, helping operators identify openings and better understand local propagation.

Key features include:

- Real-time APRS reception data from thousands of reporting stations worldwide.
- Dynamic lobes/contours showing actual reception range in distance bins (50 km, 150 km, 250 km, 500 km, 750 km).
- Interactive map controls to explore coverage by time.
- Fast, lightweight interface designed for both desktop and mobile users.

DXLook’s new VHF view is especially useful for operators interested in FM repeaters, APRS, contesting, and portable operations, providing a clear picture of when and where propagation extends beyond the usual line of sight.

With the addition of VHF, DXLook now offers radio amateurs a complementary pair of tools:

- [vhf.dxlook.com](https://vhf.dxlook.com/) for real-time local and regional propagation, and
- [dxlook.com](https://dxlook.com/) for global HF propagation, including WSPR, PSK Reporter, DX Cluster, RBN, and POTA data.

Together, they give operators a unified, real-time picture of the amateur bands — from short-range hops to worldwide contacts.
