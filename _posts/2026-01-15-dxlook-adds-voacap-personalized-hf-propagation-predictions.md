**DXLook Introduces VOACAP View — Making Professional HF Propagation Predictions Easy for Everyone**

[DXLook](https://dxlook.com/) has released a new VOACAP View that makes professional-grade HF propagation predictions accessible to amateur radio operators for the first time, without requiring technical expertise or specialized software.

VOACAP (Voice of America Coverage Analysis Program) is the gold standard for HF propagation prediction, originally developed by the U.S. government for international broadcasting. It uses sophisticated ionospheric modeling to predict which frequencies will work between any two points on Earth, based on solar activity, time of day, and seasonal variations. Until now, using VOACAP required command-line tools and configuration files that put it out of reach for most hams.

What makes DXLook's approach unique is how the VOACAP data is presented: using the same visual language as DXLook's Reports view. If you already understand how Reports work, you'll understand VOACAP immediately — same colored arcs showing propagation paths, same band indicators, same signal quality visualization. Zero learning curve.

This release marks a significant evolution for DXLook as a platform. Until now, DXLook has focused on displaying real, observed propagation data from sources like PSK Reporter, RBN, and WSPRnet. With the new VOACAP View, DXLook adds the capability to display predictions alongside that real data — giving operators both what's happening now and what's expected to happen.

The VOACAP View is driven by real-time solar data, automatically adjusting predictions based on current smoothed sunspot numbers (SSN). Predictions update hourly and cover all HF amateur bands from 80m to 10m.

The VOACAP View is now live and available to all users at [https://dxlook.com](https://dxlook.com/).
