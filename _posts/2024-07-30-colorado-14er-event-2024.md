Colorado Summits On the Air (SOTA) will be active August 2nd through 5th 2024 for the [Colorado 14er](https://ham14er.groups.io/g/ham14er/wiki/) Event. 

> Amateur Radio operators from around Colorado will be climbing Colorado Summits On The Air (SOTA) peaks and communicating with other radio amateurs across the state and around the world. Join in on the fun during the annual event by activating a summit or contacting (chasing) the mountaintop stations.  

The Colorado 14er Event is the precursor to [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/), first taking place in 1991.
