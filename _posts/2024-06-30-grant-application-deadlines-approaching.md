Grant application deadlines for programs sponsored by both the [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/) and [ARDC](https://www.ardc.net/) are nearing.

The ARRL's [Club Grant Program](http://www.arrl.org/club-grant-program?_zs=rCgim&_zl=0VQ03) which is part of the [ARRL Foundation](http://arrl.org/the-arrl-foundation) encourages amateur radio clubs to apply for grants that will help improve communities through the promotion of amateur radio. Clubs do not have to be affiliated with the ARRL or be organized as a 501(c)(3) to apply. Grants can range up to $25,000. The deadline for applications is July 26th.

July 1st is the next deadline for grant applications submitted to ARDC. After July 1st, the next application window deadline will be September 1st. ARDC grants aim to support amateur radio through education and research with a focus on science and technology. International entities and US 501(c)(3)s are eligible. Learn more on the [ARDC website](https://www.ardc.net/apply/).
