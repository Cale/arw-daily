> The [South Pasadena Amateur Radio Club](https://www.southpasradio.org/) (SPARC) invites operators from around the world to experience the frightful delight of Halloween as only our town can celebrate it. Dozens of famous movies and television shows have used South Pasadena as a location, including the original [Halloween (1978)](https://lamag.com/film/halloween-locations-40). On October 31, our club will operate outside the [South Pasadena Historical Museum](https://sppreservation.org/) which sits one block south of “Michael Myers’s house” from the classic horror film. We will use the special event call sign W6H.  

Modes of operation will include phone, CW, and FT8. Logs for the event will be logged to QRZ.com under the SPARC call [W6SPR](https://www.qrz.com/db/w6spr). QSL cards will be available. See additional updates on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.radio/@SouthPasRadio).
