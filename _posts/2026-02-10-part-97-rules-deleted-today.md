Four rules that affect amateur radio operators under Part 97 have been [marked for deletion](http://www.arrl.org/news/view/obsolete-part-97-rules-to-be-deleted-february-10-2026) by the FCC, effective today. The following four rules include:

- **§ 97.27** This provision is duplicative of a statutory provision related to the FCC’s right to modify station licenses.
- **§ 97.29** This provision specified an obsolete procedure to replace paper licenses.
- **§ 97.315 (b)(2)** This obsolete provision grandfathered HF amplifiers purchased before April 28, 1978 by an amateur radio operator for use at that operator's station, and grandfathered those manufactured before April 28, 1978, for which a marketing waiver was issued.
- **§ 97.521(b) and Appendix 2** This rule and appendix relate to obsolete VEC regions.
