*From the HAARP Program Office:*

The [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/) (HAARP) will be conducting a research campaign August 12-15 UTC, with operating times specified in the table below. Operating frequencies will vary, but all HAARP transmissions will be between 2.8 MHz and 10 MHz. Actual transmit days and times are highly variable based on real-time ionospheric and/or geomagnetic conditions. All information is subject to change.

This campaign is being conducted in support of research proposals from the Polar Aeronomy and Radio Science (PARS) Summer School. PARS is funded by the Subauroral Geophysical Observatory award (#2054361) from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), and brings students from across the nation to HAARP to conduct research. This year, 30 unique experiments will take place. The theme of this year’s program is “Active Exploration of Near-Earth Space” Scientific goals of these experiments range from studies on the effects of ionospheric conditions on GPS satellite signals to generation and propagation of extremely low frequency/very low frequency (ELF/VLF) waves. More information on PARS can be found at [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/pars2025](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/pars2025)

Note that due to the number of experiments and the need to make real-time schedule adjustments based on ionospheric conditions, no frequencies are specified in the table below. The included transmission notice supplement contains information on the frequencies HAARP is authorized to transmit. HAARP transmissions will only occur on our authorized frequencies. There are no specific data collection requests from funded investigators, but reception reports are appreciated and may be submitted to our online form at [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/form/reception-reports](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/form/reception-reports).
