Historical [WSPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)) transmissions are [playing a part](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world-news/360532248/how-ghost-radio-signals-could-hold-key-finding-missing-flight-mh370) in the search for [flight MH370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370) which went missing over the Indian Ocean 10 years ago. A retired aerospace engineer has suggested that disturbances in WSPR transmissions may reveal the area in which flight MH370 last flew. Others, including Joe Taylor, inventor of the popular WSPR mode, have suggested WSPR may not be useful in tracking aircraft.

> ...the creator of WSPR technology has suggested that historical data from the network is of little use for tracking aircraft. Nobel laureate Prof Joseph Taylor, of Princeton University, an astrophysicist and radio ham himself, developed WSPR based on his research into pulsars.

A private robotics company, [Ocean Infinity](https://oceaninfinity.com/), will include the WSPR based triangulation in their [flight MH370 search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370) grid. A start date for the new search effort has not been released.
