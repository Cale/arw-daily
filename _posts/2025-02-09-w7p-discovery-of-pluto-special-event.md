> The [Northern Arizona DX Association](https://www.nadxa.com/) will be continuing with year five of the 10-year special event countdown to the 100th anniversary of the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tompaugh at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. This annual 9-day event is held each February through the 2030 anniversary. This year's event will take place February 15-23, 2025 (UTC).

The annual cards have subjects centered around Clyde Tombaugh, the discovery of Pluto, the moons of Pluto, some of his early telescopes, lenses used, etc., with lots of great information.
