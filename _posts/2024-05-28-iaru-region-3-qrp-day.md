[QRP Day 2024](https://www.wia.org.au/newsevents/news/2024/20240401-2/index.php) takes place this coming June 17th. In 1997, IARU Region 3 declared June 17 to be QRP day to further the interest of QRP operation among amateur radio operators. Hams are asked to consider hosting QRP events, promoting QRP devices, and activating QRP stations.
