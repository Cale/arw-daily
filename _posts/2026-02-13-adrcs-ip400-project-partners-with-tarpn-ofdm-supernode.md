*The following is a press release from the Alberta Digital Radio Communications Society (ADRCS):*

The [Society](https://adrcs.org/) is pleased to [announce](https://adrcs.org/adrcs/news/) that it is collaborating with the Terrestrial Amateur Radio Packet Network group ([TARPN](https://tarpn.net/)) to implement an audio band version of its OFDM technology in their Terminal Node Controller (TNC). “Adding the TNC rounds out the vision of the supernode that we presented at the Zero Retries Digital Conference last September and extends the functionality of the IP400 network to conventional radios on the 2M, 220 and 450 MHz bands, without any modifications”, says Martin Alcock, VE6VH, founder of the [IP400 project](https://ip400.adrcs.org/). “Adding OFDM to our TNC gives us a higher speed mode than previously implemented and practical experience with OFDM”, says Nino Carrillo, KK4HEJ, creator of the TNC. Martin goes on to say “in addition it will give us access to proven KISS mode technology that will greatly enhance the utility of our existing nodes in delivering higher data rates for conventional packet radio applications on existing terrestrial networks”.
