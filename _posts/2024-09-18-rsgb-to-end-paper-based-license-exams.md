Beginning January 1st, Radio Society of Great Britain ([RSGB](https://rsgb.org/main/)) will [no longer offer paper based amateur radio licensing exams](https://rsgb.org/main/blog/news/rsgb-notices/2024/09/18/routine-availability-of-paper-exams-to-end-on-31-december-2024/) except for special educational needs. Already, 97% of all amateur license exams are conducted online remotely or within a club space. Additional costs and effort around paper based exams were cited as reasons to move to an all digital format. Key dates:

- Paper exams continue until December 13
- November 29 is the last day to book a paper exam
- Paper exams will no longer be available beginning January 1
