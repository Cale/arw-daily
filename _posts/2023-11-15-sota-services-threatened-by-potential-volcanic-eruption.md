Andy (MM0FMF), a member of the SOTA Management Team, communicated the [potential for disruption of SOTA services](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/possible-disruption-to-sota-cluster-and-sms-services/33805) such as the SOTA Cluster and SMS services should a volcanic eruption occur in Grindavik, Iceland. The data center containing SOTA services is located just outside the town of Grindavik.

With thousands of small earthquakes occurring and large cracks appearing on roads over the past few days, experts warn that a [volcanic eruption is possible](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iceland-volcano-eruption-2023-earthquakes-grindavik-b2447970.html).
