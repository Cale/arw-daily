The [Fram2](https://f2.com/) mission successfully launched from the east coast of the US via a SpaceX rocket late Monday evening. Just a few hours later around 9:30 AM Berlin time, Rabea Rogg (LB9NJ) became the first astronaut and amateur radio operator to make contact with Earth from a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. Rogg is also the [first woman from Germany in space](https://bsky.app/profile/tuberlin.bsky.social/post/3llqm3quxes2c). Contact was made between Rogg and the [DK0TU amateur radio club](https://www.dk0tu.de/) at the [Technical university of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/).

The amateur radio contact is significant as the International Space Station (ISS) faces a decommissioning date within the next 5 years. ISS has been the primary source of amateur radio voice contacts from astronauts since the NASA Space Shuttle program was sunset in 2011. Fram2 has demonstrated that SpaceX may be a viable alternative for space based amateur radio QSOs with astronauts beyond the ISS's lifespan.

In addition to voice contact with the university, Fram2 is also conducting an SSTV event, [Fram2Ham](https://fram2ham.com/), that encourages students to participate in a puzzle activity. Rogg will use a battery-powered Icom IC-705 to transmit SSTV images of polar regions that students are expected to receive and piece together to form a larger image. Because of the nature of the contest, [ARISS is asking](https://mastodon.radio/@ARISS_Intl@mastodon.hams.social/114263225513829588) any received images to not be posted to social media until after the event concludes. Fram2 is expected to orbit Earth for 3-5 days.

Anyone with a receiver capable of capturing SSTV images should tune to 437.550 MHz and expect a Robot 36 formatted image. [Doppler correction tables](https://www.ariss.org/doppler-correction-tables.html) are available from ARISS.

Fram2 is a private space flight mission funded by cryptocurrency entrepreneur and Fram2 Mission Commander [Chun Wang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chun_Wang).
