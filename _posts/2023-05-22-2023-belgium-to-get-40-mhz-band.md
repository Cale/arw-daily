The UBA proposes to grant the radio amateur service access to the frequency range 40.660 â€“ 40.690 MHz under the following conditions:

- On a secondary basis
- For holders of a class A operating certificate (HAREC licence)
- A power limit of 5 W ERP
- A bandwidth limit of 3 kHz
- On individual basis, after prior approval from BIPT
- It is mandatory to keep a logbook in which all transmissions are noted

This is an important development as Belgium now joins Ireland (EI), Slovenia (S5) and South Africa (ZS) with official amateur radio allocations on the 40 MHz band.
