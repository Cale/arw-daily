[Open-weather](https://open-weather.community/) will host an [End-of-life Nowcast](https://open-weather.community/year-of-weather/) inviting weather and radio enthusiasts to capture recordings from the NOAA 15, 18, and 19 weather satellites. WAV recordings of the satellite passes may be uploaded through the [Contributor Form](https://open-weather.community/contribute/) and will be made available on the [Public Archive](https://open-weather.community/archive/). The Nowcast takes place on June 15th.

> Public ownership and access to environmental knowledge is threatened by attempts to dismantle and privatise government agencies, such as the US governmentâ€™s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that has provided satellite images to ground stations internationally since the 70s.

NOAA weather satellites 15, 18, and 19 [will reach end-of-life](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/noaa-15-18-19-end-of-life-announcement-but-transmissions-will-continue-for-hobbyists/) status on June 16th, but will continue to transmit imagery.
