*The following is a message from DXLook:*

[DXLook](https://dxlook.com) has introduced a new QSO View that lets radio amateurs upload their own ADIF (.adi) log files and see their QSOs displayed on the map. Each contact is shown with a great-circle arc from your station to the destination, and markers include details such as callsign, grid, band, mode, date, and time. Filters for band and mode are available, and users can toggle arcs and time labels on or off. QSO View runs fully in the browser, so uploaded log files never leave your computer.

In addition, DXLook’s Help and Tour sections are now available in multiple languages (English, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese), making it easier for operators worldwide to get started.

These updates join DXLook’s existing tools — Summary, Cluster, MUF, Reports, and POTA — giving operators more ways to explore propagation and their own activity in one place.
