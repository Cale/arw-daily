Hello, I am hosting my 3rd Elmer special event on October 18 to October 20 2024. This year we have 3 calls signs, [W1E](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1E/ELMER), [W3E](https://www.qrz.com/db/W3E/ELMER) and [W4E](https://www.qrz.com/db/W4E/ELMER). It is in honor of many hams who have mentored new hams over the years. We have about 12 operators this year.

It started 3 years ago when I found out that a single operator could host their own special event. My first event was an event honoring Department of Transportation. My father owned a trucking business and was on the board of D.O.T. in CT. When I saw how well that went I thought of trying another.

I realized that I had never seen an event held for honoring all the amatuers who helped out new hams entering the hobby. So thus the idea was born and the first one was  October 2022. I have 3 webpages on QRZ.com that tells about the event. The calls signs are:

- [W1E/Elmer](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1E/ELMER)
- [W3E/Elmer](https://www.qrz.com/db/W3E/ELMER)
- [W4E/Elmer](https://www.qrz.com/db/W4E/ELMER)
