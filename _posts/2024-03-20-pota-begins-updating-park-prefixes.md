**Update 3/25/2024**   
China is [once again participating in the POTA program](https://docs.pota.app/docs/changes/2024-03-14-china.html) after resolving a simple misunderstanding due to language barriers.

In an effort to [reorganize the Parks on the Air (POTA) database](https://docs.pota.app/docs/changes.html) in a way that meets [ISO standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2), POTA has begun rolling out changes to the way park entities are prefixed. Beginning with the United States and Puerto Rico, parks previously coded with a *K* prefix will now be listed with a *US* prefix. For example, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail was previously *K-4556* and is now *US-4556*. Additional prefixes will be [updated in the coming days](https://docs.pota.app/docs/changes/upcoming.html).

While the changes are largely seamless from a systems perspective, activators will be required to use the new prefixes when uploading logs. Logging software supporting POTA will also need to be adjusted. 

From a political perspective, the prefix change has resulted in China choosing to [no longer participate](https://docs.pota.app/docs/changes/2024-03-14-china.html) in the POTA program due to the ISO3166-2 standard recognizing Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan as top-level entities. 

The [timeline of prefix changes may be viewed here](https://docs.pota.app/docs/changes/upcoming.html).
