The global efforts of amateur radio operators are calling attention to the urgent needs of abandoned, abused, neglected and homeless dogs by operating special event stations in Europe and the US to mark [International Dog Day](http://dogdayradio.org/). This year is the largest such activation among hams as Hanz, YL3JD, who originated the special event, will be on the air as YL1DOG for all of August and September. He will also be participating in a number of activities, such as the International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend in late August. Chris G5VZ and David G4YVM will be on the air as GB0DOG and GB4DOG, respectively. Listen for Chris from the 30th of July through to the 26th of August and for David from the 1st to the 27th of August. In the US, a team coordinated by Caryn KD2GUT, will be calling QRZ with the special event callsign K2D from the 21st to the 26th of August. They will be using CW and SSB on the HF bands.

International Dog Day is August 26th. The hams are hoping to spotlight the need for rescue, assistance, adoption and donation around the world.
