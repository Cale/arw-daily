The [American Radio Relay League](http://arrl.org/) (ARRL) recently named the 40th anniversary celebration planned by [Amateur Radio on the International Space Station](https://www.ariss.org/) (ARISS) an ARRL-sanctioned Specialty Conference. This special designation from ARRL will provide additional marketing opportunities for the ARISS event including mentions in the ARRL weekly email and monthly journal.

The [ARISS 40th Anniversary Conference](https://www.ariss.org/overview.html) will celebrate the positive impact of amateur radio on human spaceflight. The event takes place at the [Center for Space Education](https://www.amfcse.org/about-the-cse) at the NASA Kennedy Space Center Visitor's Center in Titusville, Florida February 22-24, 2024.

Amateur radio operation on human spaceflight first occurred in 1983 when astronaut [Owen Garriott](https://www.amsat.org/first-ham-in-space-amsat-life-member-owen-garriott-w5lfl-sk/) (W5LFL) made contact with amateur radio operators from the Space Shuttle Columbia.
