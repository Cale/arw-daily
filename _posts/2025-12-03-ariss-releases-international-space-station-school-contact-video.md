[ARISS](https://www.ariss.org/) has released a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egnzgGG3wwE) promoting amateur radio on the International Space Station (ISS). Produced by NASA, the video features astronaut Nichole Ayers (KJ5GWI) aboard the ISS explaining how amateur radio plays a part in school contacts with astronauts on the ISS. Ayers explains many of the procedures and technical challenges that amateur radio operators must address during a school contact.

> [I]t's a true privilege for me to be able to inspire the new generation of scientists and engineers through amateur radio. &mdash;Astronaut Nichole Ayers (KJ5GWI)
