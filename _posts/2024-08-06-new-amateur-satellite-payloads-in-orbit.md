Two new satellites carrying several amateur radio focused payloads are now in orbit.

SONATE-2 originates from Julius-Maximilians-Universität in Germany and features an APRS digipeater. 421 messages were digipeated this past weekend. The satellite also features a VHF transceiver with SSTV downlink sending images captured by onboard cameras.

**SSTV downlink**
- Regular downlink of images captured by the on-board cameras
- Frequency: 145.880 MHz
- Modulation: Martin M1 SSTV FM (F3F)
- TX Power: 500mW

**APRS digipeater**
- APRS digipeater in half-duplex operation. Digipeater is only active when published at [https://x.com/JMUSpace](https://x.com/JMUSpace). When activated, it will transmit a greeting message every 2 minutes
- Make sure to include SONATE-2 callsign DPØSNX in the APRS route
- Frequency: 145.825 MHz Up/Down
- Modulation: 1k2 AFSK (F2D)
- Protocol: AX.25
- TX Power: 500mW

ROBUSTA-3A, a 3U CubeSat built by students at Université de Montpellier in southern France, carries a 9k6 GMSK AX.25 store-and-forward digital system. The UHF transmitter features a powerful 3 watt downlink. Procedures and uplink frequency will be published soon. In the meantime, short telemetry bursts can be heard on its downlink frequency of 436.750 MHz.
