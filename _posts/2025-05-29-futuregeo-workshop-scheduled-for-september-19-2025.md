AMSAT-DL has [scheduled](https://amsat-dl.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMSAT-Organisations-futureGEO-RFEI.pdf) the first futureGEO workshop for September 19th. While it's not immediately clear what the workshop will cover, based on the [RFEI document](https://amsat-dl.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMSAT-Organisations-futureGEO-RFEI.pdf) in which the workshop is mentioned, we're likely to learn which amateur radio organizations will be actively involved in the futureGEO project, see discussion of potential payloads, as well as learn lessons from the QO-100 and related missions.

The workshop will take place during the [AMSAT-DL Symposium](https://amsat-dl.org/en/category/symposium-general-meeting-hamradio/) at the Bochum Observatory in Germany.
