The [University of Scranton](https://www.scranton.edu/) [W3USR](https://www.qrz.com/db/W3USR) Amateur Radio Club is [dedicating](https://news.scranton.edu/articles/2024/10/news-physics-ham-radio-station-w3usr-dedication.shtml) a state-of-the-art amateur radio station for use with physics courses and research by students and faculty participating in the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation ([HamSCI](https://hamsci.org/)) project led by Nathaniel Frissell, Ph.D., associate professor of physics and engineering at University of Scranton.

> Located on the fifth floor of the Loyola Science Center, the main station has floor to ceiling glass walls with sweeping views of the city of Scranton. Last academic year, a 40-foot tower with a Skyhawk High Frequency antenna for 14, 21, and 28 MHz, as well as VHF/UHF satellite and microwave antennas, some with rotating mounts were installed, in addition to heavy-duty controllers, all-mode transceivers, speakers, desktop microphones and other components.

Grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications ([ARDC](https://www.ardc.net/)) foundation and other organizations have contributed to this project.
