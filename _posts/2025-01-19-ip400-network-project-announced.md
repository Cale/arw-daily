Designed by Martin Alcock (VE6VH) with support from the [Alberta Digital Radio Communications Society](https://adrcs.org/) (ADRCS), the [IP400 Network Project](https://adrcs.org/adrcs/ip400-network-project/) is designed to enhance amateur radio repeaters. IP400 aims to bring digital voice modes, data transfers, messaging, and a data networking layer that links repeaters together via RF.

The [latest issue of Zero Retries](https://www.zeroretries.org/p/zero-retries-0185) features in-depth [write-ups](https://www.zeroretries.org/p/zero-retries-0185?open=false#%C2%A7background-and-details-on-the-ip-project) of IP400, including a message from VE6VH [outlining](https://www.zeroretries.org/p/zero-retries-0185?open=false#%C2%A7introduction-to-the-ip-project-vevh) the history and vision of the project. 

> We have a ground floor opportunity to develop our own mesh network in the 420-450 MHz band that can be used for many different applications, the limit of which is the imagination alone. The first step is to get a simple chat and beaconing application running to experiment with the technology. From there we can layer on other features and frame types, and then consider moving into the repeater world. To give the project a name, it has been dubbed ‘IP400’, for Intelligent (not Internet!) Protocol.

- Those interested in the project can join the [IP400 Groups.io list](https://groups.io/g/ip400).
- A [GitHib repository](https://github.com/ve6vh/ip400) of initial software has been established.
