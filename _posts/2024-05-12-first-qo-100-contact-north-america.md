The first contact through the QO-100 geostationary satellite made from North America took place on May 11th from Newfoundland, Canada. VO1/M0XUU (VU3HPF) made a trans-atlantic FT8 contact with G0MRF in London. The contact is significant considering the QO-100 footprint falls beyond Newfoundland at -0.9Â° below the horizon.
