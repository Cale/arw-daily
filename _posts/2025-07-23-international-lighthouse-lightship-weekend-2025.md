[International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend](https://illw.net/) (ILLW) will take place August 16th through 17th. Originally started in 1993 by the [Ayr Amateur Radio Group](https://gm0ayr.org/) in Scotland as the Northern Lighthouse Activity Weekend, ILLW now coincides with many countries' honoring of lighthouses in August each year. 

> The ILLW usually takes place on the 3rd full weekend in August each year and attracts over 500 lighthouse entries located in over 40 countries. It is one of the most popular international amateur radio events in existence probably because there are very few rules and it is not the usual contest type event.

More information is available on the [ILLW website](https://illw.net/).
