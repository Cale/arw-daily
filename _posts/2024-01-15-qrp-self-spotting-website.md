[QRP Cluster](https://www.qrpcluster.com/) enables hams operating low power to self-spot for others to work them.

> ...low power is fun, but especially if we manage to make QSO's or contacts. QRP signals are usually weak and easily missed in noise and interference. That's why we came up with the idea of creating a QRP self spotting Cluster, where every QRP broadcasting enthusiast can announce on which frequency they are working, in which mode, or with what equipment and power they are working.
