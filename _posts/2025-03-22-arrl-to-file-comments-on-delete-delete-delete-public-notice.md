The ARRL has [announced](https://www.arrl.org/news/view/fcc-initiates-broad-inquiry-on-rules-to-delete-or-amend) its intent to file comments on the FCC's recent Public Notice, *[In Re: Delete, Delete, Delete](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-219A1.pdf)*. In the Public Notice, the FCC has asked for public comment on rules that should be modified or removed. 

> Rules [related to amateur radio] identified as outmoded, obsolete, or that for other reasons should be repealed or modified, will be included in ARRLâ€™s filing to be submitted no later than the FCC deadline of April 11, 2025.

ARRL suggested a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will be published later this year containing rule changes the FCC may adopt.
