[Playground Amateur Radio Club](https://w4zbb.org/) (PARC) has released an easy to use, printable table to help [SARnet](https://sarnetfl.org/) users traverse repeaters as they travel Florida's highways.

> Your 3x5 index cards will make it simple as you travel the interstates or turnpike. Select the channel covering the mile marker where you entered
the highway, and press your channel ⬆️ or ⬇️ button at each suggested mile marker.

PARC has [provided a PDF and CSV file](https://w4zbb.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/parc_sarnet_v100.zip) with full instructions available from their website.
