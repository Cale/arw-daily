This year and next will feature a solar eclipse in North America â€“ a rare series of events not repeated in our lifetimes. Study of the Sun and the Earth will be the focus of much science that ham radio will participate, with the ionosphere of primary interest. Our collaboration with HAMSCI for the annual eclipse in October 2023 is a good example.

Our May Kawfee Tawk is a basic introduction to the sun and its effect, and how the ionosphere works. We hear
a lot of terms used in our hobby, such as sunspots, CME, K index, solar flux, etc., but what do they mean, and how can we understand them?

This video program via Zoom will be held on Friday, May 19th, 2023 beginning at 7:30 PM EDT.
