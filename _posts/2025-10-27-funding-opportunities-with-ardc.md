[ARDC](https://www.ardc.net/) currently has funding opportunities open for projects, with the next application deadline on February 1, 2026.

ARDC is [especially interested in projects](https://www.ardc.net/apply/priority-areas-for-funding/) that align with these three areas:

- **Research & Development (R&D):** open hardware and software systems that enable learning and experimentation (e.g. SDRs, open codec technologies, new modulation techniques).
- **Space-Based Communications:** projects that create or expand access to satellite communications for amateur radio (AR) and digital communications (DC), engaging communities in wireless experimentation (e.g. GEO or HEO programs, repurposed commercial satellites, space-based tools for learning).
- **Open Source Education:** scalable, open educational materials and hands-on projects that make AR and DC more accessible, especially for new learners and clubs (e.g. curricula, videos).

While ARDC welcomes proposals across the full range of AR and DC, projects that align with these areas remain a priority in ARDC's grantmaking decisions.
