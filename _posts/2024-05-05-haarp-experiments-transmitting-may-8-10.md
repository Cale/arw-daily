The [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/) (HAARP) will conduct experiments within the 2.8 to 10 MHz frequency range May 8 through 10. Originating from Alaska, the transmissions are part of a research effort from the University of Alaska Fairbanks to detect orbiting space debris. Modulation may be AM, FM, LFM or a complex waveform or a time sequence of different modulations. QSL cards are available by request via
