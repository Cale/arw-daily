Each year a series of [Military Radio Nets](https://ve3ips.wordpress.com/2025/03/29/dayton-hamvention-xenia-military-net-update/) take place during Hamvention. This year includes the *WW2 Low Power & Backpack Net* and the *Cold War Backpack & Handheld Net*.

**WW2 Low Power & Backpack Net**   
1200 Local Time   
3885 AM

**Cold War Backpack & Handheld Net**

> The 51.0 Cold War Net will be radios like the PRC-6, PRC-10, RT-70, PRC-25 and 77 with a good representation of older sets from the BC-1000 to newer SINGARS sets. We will also have a good showing of German, Russian and the last couple years captured Iraqi radios. The Czech RF_10 is another popular radio.
