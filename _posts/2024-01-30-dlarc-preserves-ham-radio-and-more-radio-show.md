In addition to the vast collection of ham radio related magazines, newsletters, podcasts, and software, [DLARC](https://archive.org/details/dlarc) recently added 464 hours of *[Ham Radio and More](https://archive.org/details/hamradioandmore)*, an amateur radio themed commercial radio show broadcast throughout the 1990s.

>Ham Radio & More was a radio show about amateur radio that was broadcast from 1991 through 1997. More than 300 episodes of the program are now available online as part of the Digital Library of Amateur Radio & Communications (DLARC).

>Ham Radio & More was the first radio show devoted to ham radio on the commercial radio band. It began as a one-hour show on KFNN 1510 AM in Phoenix, Arizona, then expanded to a two-hour format and national syndication. The programâ€™s host, Len Winkler, invited guests to discuss the issues of the day and educate listeners about various aspects of the radio hobby. Today the episodes, some more than 30 years old, provide an invaluable time capsule of the ham radio hobby.
