*Rajesh Vagadia ([VU2EXP](https://www.qrz.com/db/vu2exp)) shares an exciting account of demonstrating amateur radio to a groups of students at Shri KV Parekh Science College for Natational Sciene Day.*

On the occasion of National Science Day, February 28, 2025, I, Rajesh Vagadia (VU2EXP), had the privilege of conducting a Ham Radio awareness program at the renowned Shri KV Parekh Science College in Mahuva, Gujarat (India). This prestigious institution, established by the founder of the Pidilite Group, played host to an enlightening session on Amateur Radio, coordinated by the Bhavnagar Science Center with the generous support of AMSAT-INDIA and The Amateur Radio Society of India (ARSI).

## Journey to Mahuva and APRS Experiment

My XYL (wife) Kiran Vagadia and I embarked on our journey from Rajkot in the morning, carrying with us a range of Ham Radio equipment for demonstrations. As a live experiment, we utilized Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) to track our travel progress. Our team member Shyama Vagadia (VU3WHG-10) set up the tracking, allowing students, faculty, and ham community to monitor our movement via the aprs.fi network. This interactive exercise was well received and demonstrated real-time radio tracking capabilities.

It was the modern-day version of ‘Are we there yet?’—except this time, students and fellow hams could actually see us moving in real-time!

## Warm Welcome and Equipment Showcase

Upon arrival at Mahuva, we were warmly greeted by college authorities, faculty members, and enthusiastic students. We set up an elaborate display of Ham Radio equipment, including transceivers, antennas, walkie-talkies, CW keys, oscillators, a Cube Satellite model, SDR dongles, measuring instruments, amateur radio documents, logbooks, licenses, awards, and books for reference. This hands-on exposure helped attendees understand the practical aspects of amateur radio operations.

## Informative Session and Interactive Presentation

The session commenced with a short video clip from the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) that provided an introductory glimpse into the world of Amateur Radio. Our main presentation covered the rich history of Ham Radio, tracing its evolution and technological advancements from CW to Satellite!  Students were particularly fascinated to learn that Ham Radio is the oldest form of social media!

“Before WhatsApp, before Twitter, before Instagram, before even the dial-up internet sound haunted our childhood, Ham Radio operators were already chatting across the globe—without any emoji, instead only smiley icon represented by character HI!”

We introduced our organizations, AMSAT-INDIA and Amateur Radio Society of India and it’s role. We did provided an explanation of Ham Radio's technical workings and it’s operations. Key topics covered included:

- Types of radios / modes and their applications
- Various modes and frequencies used in amateur radio
- Importance of antennas and their different configurations
- Exciting Ham Radio events such as IOTA (Islands on the Air), Hilltop operations, Lighthouse activations, JOTA (Jamboree on the Air), POTA (Park on the Air), etc
- Usage of RST System, Ham terminology, Q-Codes, abbreviations, and callsign country prefixes
- The procedure for obtaining a Ham Radio license, syllabus, and study resources

We also highlighted modern advancements in the field, such as; Moon Bounce (EME), Satellite Communications (LEO, MEO, GEO), APRS, Tracking High Altitude Balloon (HAB),  HF weak signal modes for challenging conditions, repeater usage, Nets, and the thrill of Contesting.

## The Power of RTL-SDR for Non-Hams

It was an exciting aspect for students how anyone can explore the radio spectrum using an RTL-SDR dongle, without requiring a Ham Radio license. With this affordable device, students are encouraged to experiment to;

- Listen to Amateur Radio conversation & OSCAR Satellite downlinks
- Receive NOAA Weather Satellite real time images
- Track aircraft via ADS-B
- Monitor ISS communications / Voice repeater
- Receive SSTV Images from ISS

“Who needs Netflix when you can explore the airwaves!”

## Special ARISS Audio Clip and Live VHF Demonstration

A particularly inspiring moment came when we played a recorded audio clip from the ARISS student outreach program, where my daughter Sakshi Vagadia (VU3EXP) had a live telebridge conversation with astronaut Sunita Williams KD5PLB aboard the International Space Station on November 14, 2012. The students were thrilled to witness the real-world impact of Ham Radio in space communications. (YouTube link: Click Here)

To give students hands-on experience, we conducted a live VHF demonstration. Dividing participants into three groups, we enabled them to communicate using Ham Radio terminology. The excitement among students and faculty was evident as they pressed the PTT button and spoke over the radio for the first time!

## Encouraging Future Participation

The event concluded with very positive feedback and a vote of thanks delivered over the radio by college teachers and Shri Harshad Joshi Sir. A notable outcome of the session was the overwhelming interest shown by students and faculty in establishing an amateur radio club on campus. We assured our support in guiding them through the process.

## Visit to Jegri Island Lighthouse

After the event, we took the opportunity to visit the picturesque Jegri Island Lighthouse, located just 11 km away. Surrounded on three sides by the sea, this magnificent 30-meter-high square masonry tower, adorned with 4 black and white bands, left us mesmerized.

Standing at the Jegri Island Lighthouse, surrounded by the sea, I couldn’t help but think—what a perfect place for my possible 3rd lighthouse activation!  I hope to return here to activate this lighthouse under the International Lighthouse & Lightship Weekend  (ILLW) program.

## Conclusion

With a total journey spanning 550 km in a day, this was a rewarding experience dedicated to educating young minds about the fascinating world of Ham Radio on National Science Day. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Shri KV Parekh Science College, Bhavnagar Science Center, AMSAT-INDIA, ARSI, and all those who contributed to making this event a success. A special thanks to my XYL, Kiran Vagadia, for her constant support throughout the program.
