The engineering table at the [AMSAT](https://www.amsat.org/) booth at [Hamvention](https://hamvention.org/) will be staffed with a number of engineers actively working on various AMSAT projects. A full-scale model of the [GOLF-TEE](https://www.amsat.org/greater-orbit-larger-footprint-an-introduction-to-the-amsat-golf-program/) (Technology Exploration Environment) satellite will highlight the payload space of a 10cm x 10cm x 30cm spaceframe as well as the accompanying solar panel arrays.

Engineers from [Fox-Plus](https://www.amsat.org/meet-the-fox-project/) and Advanced Satellite Communication and Exploration of New Technology (ASCENT) projects will be available for additional questions. SSTV and packet repeater payloads for CubeSats are current ASCENT projects.
