February 20, 2026 — [DXLook.com](https://dxlook.com/) has released two new composite map views designed to help amateur radio operators compare actual on-air results with propagation expectations in one place. The update adds Reports + MUF and Reports + VOACAP, allowing operators to see where signals are being reported versus where models suggest they should propagate—without switching between separate tools or screens.

### New Composite Views

**Reports + MUF**   
This view overlays real contact reports (solid arcs) on top of MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency) zones. The colored zones represent the highest usable band by direction, helping operators quickly confirm whether contacts align with expected openings and identify unusual paths such as grey-line effects, sporadic-E, or long-path propagation.

**Reports + VOACAP**   
This view overlays real contact reports (solid lines) with VOACAP theoretical predictions (dashed, semi-transparent arcs). It provides a direct side-by-side visual comparison between model-based expectations and real-world activity, making it easier to spot agreement, gaps, and surprises.

**How to Access**   
Operators can try the new views by visiting dxlook.com, selecting Reports + MUF or Reports + VOACAP from the View dropdown, then entering a callsign or grid square and clicking Go.

**Update Details**   

- The MUF/VOACAP prediction backdrop refreshes every 5 minutes independently
- Reports refresh based on the selected time window (1 minute to 24 hours)
- Existing Reports features remain available, including filters for band/mode/direction, marker options, and the spot table

DXLook.com is free to use, requires no login, and aggregates data from PSK Reporter, Reverse Beacon Network (RBN), WSPRnet, and DX Cluster, supporting bands from 160m through 2m.

**About DXLook.com**   
[DXLook.com](https://dxlook.com/) is a web-based platform that combines reception reports and propagation-focused views to help amateur radio operators monitor activity, understand band conditions, and explore propagation patterns in real time.
