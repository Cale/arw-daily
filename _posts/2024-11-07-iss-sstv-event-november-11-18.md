SSTV images will be transmitted from the International Space Station between November 11th and 18th. The images will feature activities from the [40th Anniversary Celebrating Amateur Radio in Human Spaceflight](https://ariss-usa.org/40th-anniversary-celebration-of-the-positive-impact-of-amateur-radio-on-human-spaceflight/), an event hosted by ARISS earlier this year at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

> The event is scheduled to begin on Monday, November 11 at 11:50 UTC and to end Monday, November 18 at 13:40 UTC. SSTV transmissions will be paused during scheduled school contacts on November 15 and 16. Downlink transmissions will be at 145.800 MHz and the mode is expected to be PD 120.

Certificates will be available to operators uploading images to the [ARISS SSTV gallery](https://ariss-usa.org/ARISS_SSTV/).
