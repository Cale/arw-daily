> On Monday, September 11, as part of the 2023 Handiham Radio Camp, we will be conducting a... special event QSO party to honor the 56th Anniversary of the [Courage Kenny Handiham Program](https://handiham.org/). Our goal is to work as many stations as possible throughout the United States and beyond. We will operate on both SSB and CW on 10, 15, 20, and 40 meters as conditions and our antennas allow from 11 AM – 4 PM Central daylight time (16:00 – 21:00 UTC). We will be using both W0ZSW and W0EQO, two call signs with a rich history in the Handiham Program.

The Courage Kenny Handiham Program helps people with disabilities earn their amateur radio license and get on the air. The goal is to assist in all aspects of life while promoting STEM related activities. 

Since 1967, the Handiham mission has been “To empower people with disabilities to reach their full potential in every aspect of life.”
