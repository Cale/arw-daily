[Amateur Radio Satellites and Systems - Canada](https://amsat-ca.org/) (AMSAT-CA) has officially been incorporated to support amateur radio in space. Over the next few months, AMSAT-CA will establish processes around its online presence as well as membership opportunities.

The first major effort from AMSAT-CA will be to develop a paper in support of the [European Space Agency's proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FTvlEyDa1Y&t=37s) for a European and Canadian geosynchronous amateur radio satellite project.
