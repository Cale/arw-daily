*The following special event information is from the [Alabama Contest Group](https://alabamacontestgroup.org/).*

**It was 25 years ago but We Do Remember You as if it was yesterday and always will.**

Special Event to Honor the Victims of 9-11: New York City Shanksville PA. and Washington D.C.

Many members of the Alabama Contest Group will activate K4A for the fifth year. This year's event will be called "9-11 We Do Remember." We will operate all modes  SSB, FT8, CW, and RTTY. We will try to be on all bands 160 through 10 meters, including WARC bands.

This year a new special QSL and certificate "We Do Remember" theme  will be available.

To those who contact K4A on 3 bands using any combination of bands/modes we will offer a full color glossy certificate on heavy paper which will be mailed in a full size Manila envelope all postage paid by the Alabama Contest Group, even if you are DX. 
 
If you qualify for the certificate send your QSL to WA1FCN. Put each QSO information on your QSL. We request a $3.00 donation to help cover cost of Special Event.

Or, for our QSL only (no certificate), send your QSL and your SASE to Bob Sarnecki NF7D.
