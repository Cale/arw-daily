On Saturday, March 7, women interested in amateur radio and portable operating are invited to spend the day together at Owens Lodge, Pineway Ponds Park along the Erie Canal in Spencerport, NY for a relaxed YL POTA Party.

Parks On The Air (POTA) is an amateur radio activity that encourages operators to set up portable stations in parks and make contacts from the field. The YL POTA Party is an exciting way for women of all ages to experience portable operating, learn by doing, and enjoy time on the air together. You do not need to be licensed to participate.

Starting at 9:00 AM, the day kicks off with setting up portable stations and getting on the air, with plenty of time to operate, chat, and enjoy food throughout the day (we just need to be out by 9 PM). Bring your own portable equipment or operate from ours.

Similar YL POTA parties are held each year around International Women’s Day, with gatherings planned worldwide to celebrate women’s contributions to radio and their involvement in the hobby.

Please RSVP to Angela N3ARB and Matt K2EAG by email at brown@brownbuffalo.com.
