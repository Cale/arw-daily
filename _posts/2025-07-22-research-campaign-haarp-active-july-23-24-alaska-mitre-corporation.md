*The following is a message from HAARP:*

The [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/) (HAARP) will be conducting a [research
campaign](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/transmissions) July 23-24 UTC, with operating times specified in the table below. Operating frequencies are specified below.

This campaign is being conducted in support of research by The MITRE Corporation. The primary objective is to transmit newly developed, complex waveforms to assess their propagation characteristics over long distances. All information is subject to change based on real-time ionospheric or other conditions.

There are no specific data collection requests from funded investigators, but reception reports are welcome and may be submitted online via our web form at: [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/form/reception-reports](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/form/reception-reports). Please note that responses to reception reports may take some time, as we often receive a very high volume of reports.

**July 23**   
- 1900-2100 UTC, 2300-0100 UTC
- 6.9 MHz, 9.6 MHz

**July 24**   
- 1700-1900 UTC, 2100-2300 UTC
- 6.9 MHz, 9.6 MHz

Transmissions will be directed towards the south-southeast.

For updates on ionospheric conditions in Gakona, please consult ionograms from the HAARP Diagnostic Suite: [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/diagnostic-suite](ttps://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/diagnostic-suite)
