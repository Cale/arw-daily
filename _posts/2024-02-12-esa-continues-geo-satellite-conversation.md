On Sunday February 4th, [Frank Zeppenfeldt](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/speaker/3QJFPU/) of the European Space Agency (ESA) gave a [presentation at FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2084-design-of-a-follow-up-qo-100-payload-/) encouraging feedback from amateur radio operators on the subject of a potential follow-up geostationary satellite to QO-100.

> The satellite communications group of the European Space Agency (ESA) would like to support the collection of requirements, ideas and designs for a follow-up of [QO-100] in collaboration with IARU and various AMSAT communities. We would like to collect lessons learned and ideas on a QO-100 follow up, and trade-off some design together with amateurs, industry and ESA.

A geostationary satellite [proposal](https://daily.hamweekly.com/2023/12/geo-satellite-proposal-covers-north-america-lasers/) for portions of Europe and North America was proposed in late 2023.
