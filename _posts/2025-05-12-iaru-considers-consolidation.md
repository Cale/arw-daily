The [IARU](https://www.iaru.org/) has [released guidance](https://www.iaru-r2.org/en/consultation-on-the-restructuring-of-iaru/) on potential restructuring to help the organization meet modern challenges. The proposed changes would combine the 3 separate regional organizations into a single global entity.

The [proposal](https://www.iaru-r2.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IARU-Consultation-on-Proposed-Restructuring_march_2025.pdf) (PDF) outlines a number of areas where the currently independent, regional organizations struggle. Problem areas include declining membership, duplication of resources, lack of coordination, and other various inefficiencies. The changes are designed to establish a number of benefits:

- Global representation
- Streamlined decision making
- Better allocation of resources
- Improved communication
- Long-term sustainability
- Centralized finances
- Greater influence

Member societies will vote on the restructuring with the potential for a transition as early as next year. The full [consultation on restructuring](https://www.iaru-r2.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IARU-Consultation-on-Proposed-Restructuring_march_2025.pdf) (PDF) is available on the IARU website.
