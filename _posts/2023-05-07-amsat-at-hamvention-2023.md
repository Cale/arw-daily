The Dayton Hamvention is coming May 19th-21st! AMSAT's presence includes several events throughout the weekend and in with eight adjoining booths in Building 1. Highlighting the exhibit will be:

- SatPC32 software demonstrations
- The AMSAT CubeSat Simulator
- The AMSAT Youth Initiative / KidzSat
- AMSAT Engineering staff question and answer table
- OSCAR ground station for live satellite operations
- Annual Membership sign-up and renewals
- AMSAT President's Club recognition
- AMSAT Board of Directors and Senior Officers Meet and Greet
- AMSAT Store offering AMSAT trinkets, books and Arrow Antennas
- And much more!

The interaction with AMSAT members, satellite operators, designers, and builders makes the whole experience a lot of fun. Meet or renew acquaintances, exchange operating tips, and find out what antennas, software and equipment other AMSAT members use. We currently expect many of AMSAT's senior officers and board members to be there too.
