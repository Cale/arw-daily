## DXLook – Where Your Signal Is Heard

We’ve all been there.

You call CQ on 15 meters, the radio’s alive, conditions seem okay… but you’re not getting answers. So, you do what most of us do — check propagation. Maybe you fire up PSK Reporter, or flip to WSPRnet, or check the DX Cluster. But you end up hopping between tabs, trying to piece together the story of what’s actually going on out there.

That’s exactly what led me to build this tool.

At its core, [DXLook](https://dxlook.com/) is a real-time HF propagation map for amateur radio operators. But unlike other tools that show you where someone else’s signal was heard, DXLook helps you answer “Where is my signal being received right now?”

Reception-Focused, Not Just Propagation

Propagation maps are great — but most of them are based on predicted or averaged conditions. DXLook flips the perspective and focuses on actual reception data, in real time. It visualizes who’s hearing your signal, what band they heard it on, and how strong it was. Think of it as your personal propagation mirror.

So instead of asking “Is 20m open?” you can now ask “Who’s actually hearing me on 20m — right now?”

### All the Data, One Map

This is where DXLook stands out.

Instead of depending on a single source like WSPRnet or PSK Reporter, it brings all the major reception sources together:

- WSPRnet: beacon-level SNR across the globe
- Reverse Beacon Network: CW/FT8 spots with detailed timing
- PSK Reporter: digital mode activity
- DX Clusters: voice spots and DX alerts
- POTA: Parks on the Air activator activity
- Plus solar data overlays: MUF, SFI, A/K index, and day/night terminator

You can filter by mode, band, view from your local Maidenhead grid to see what’s being heard in your region.

### Who It’s For

Whether you’re a new Technician trying to understand how far your signal travels, or a seasoned DXer trying to squeeze the most out of the grey line, DXLook helps you see the invisible. It’s also pretty handy during contests, POTA activations, or just for those “Is anyone out there?” moments.

### No Login. No Tracking. Just Radio.

DXLook runs in your browser, no sign-up needed, no nonsense. It’s open to everyone — just visit [dxlook.com](https://dxlook.com/) and you’re in. You’ll see an interactive map updating live as new reception reports come in.

It’s not meant to replace other tools, but to unify them — and give you a clearer picture of what’s happening on the bands, right now.

So next time you spin the dial and wonder if you’re being heard… fire up DXLook.

See you on the air.
