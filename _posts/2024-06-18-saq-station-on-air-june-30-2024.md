[The Alexander association](https://alexander.n.se/en/) in Sweden is celebrating [Alexanderson Day](https://alexander.n.se/en/alexanderson-day-2024/) on June 30th 2024 with CW transmissions on 17.2 kHz utilizing the SAQ radio transmitter that was first used in 1924. At that time the transmitter was used to transmit across the Atlantic ocean to Long Island, NY, USA.

Messages are scheduled to be transmitted at 09:00 UTC and 12:00 UTC on June 30th. If you can't hear the transmissions over the air, the event can be viewed live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-83S-l9JKD1iuhsXx3XQ3g?sub_confirmation=1).

Test transmissions may take place on June 28th. QSL reports will be accepted. An amateur radio station, SK6SAQ, will also be on the air to mark the event.
