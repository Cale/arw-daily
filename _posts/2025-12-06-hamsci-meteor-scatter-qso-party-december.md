[HamSCI](https://www.hamsci.org/) will host the second half of its 2025 [meteor scatter QSO party](https://www.hamsci.org/msqp) December 12-13. The December event will take advantage of the [Geminid meteor shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids) and allow amateur radio operators to conduct QSOs via MSK144 mode. HamSCI expects hundreds of participants on the 6 meter and 10 meter bands.

In addition to QSOs, HamSCI is requesting audio recordings of decoded pings. This is possible through the [WSJT-X](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html) software suite.
