April 18th, 2025 is World Amateur Radio Day. Today marks the 100th anniversary of the formation of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) in Paris. 

From the IARU:

> Amateur Radio experimenters were the first to discover that the short wave spectrum — far from being a wasteland — could support worldwide propagation. In the rush to use these shorter wavelengths, Amateur Radio was “in grave danger of being pushed aside,” the IARU’s history has noted. Amateur Radio pioneers met in Paris in 1925 and created the IARU to support Amateur Radio worldwide.

Many events are taking place on-the-air to honor this event:
