The [Alberta Digital Radio Communications Society](https://adrcs.org/) (ADRCS) has announced that its grant to advance their [IP400 Network Project](https://ip400.adrcs.org/) has been approved by [ARDC](https://www.ardc.net/). ADRCS expects to begin work this coming fall.

> “This grant will ensure that we can continue our development activity and bring the project goals to fruition”, says Martin Alcock, VE6VH, Chief Technology Officer of the Society and project founder. “It will enable us to recruit top-notch personnel that would have normally been out of our reach”.

The IP400 Project aims to deliver a data communications system capable of 100 kbps minimum data speeds. Initial hardware in the form of Raspberry Pi Zero HAT transceivers were demoed at Hamvention.
