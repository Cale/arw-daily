Unfortunately, user error resulted in these interviews being lost. However, I wanted to relay some of the news gathered from these conversations.

On the [MMDVM](https://mmdvm.com/) front, we discussed AllStar support and learned that additional staff is being hired to focus on integrating this mode to be interoperable with the existing supported digital voice modes.

> MMDVM hardware and software is at the core of most digital mode hotspots on the market. The success of the MMDVM Project comes from countless hours of work by different people and projects going back to the earliest days on D-STAR. MMDVM now supports D-STAR, DMR, YSF, P25, NXDN, M17, POCSAG, and even analog.

[M17](https://m17project.org/) and [FreeDV](https://freedv.org/) were exhibiting in the same booth. Mooneer showed off the ezDV device [availlable through TAPR](https://tapr.org/product/ezdv/) (sold out at Hamvention) capable of allowing existing radios take advantage of FreeDV.

> ezDV is a handheld hardware device that allows easy use of FreeDV, whether on the go or at home. Powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, its built-in Wi-Fi support allows completely wireless setup (with supported radios) along with enabling more modern functionality such as FreeDV Reporter reporting and wireless firmware updates. For those radios without network capability, interfacing them with ezDV is straightforward through the use of the industry standard 3.5mm TRRS audio jack.

Apologies to these projects for fumbling the audio recordings.
