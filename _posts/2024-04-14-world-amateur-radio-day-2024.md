> World Amateur Radio Day, held on April 18 each year, is celebrated worldwide by radio amateurs and their national associations which are organized as member-societies of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). It was on this day in 1925 that the IARU was formed in Paris. American Radio Relay League (ARRL) Co-Founder Hiram Percy Maxim was its first president.
>
> The theme for 2024 is "A Century of Connections: Celebrating 100 years of Amateur Radio Innovation, Community, and Advocacy"
