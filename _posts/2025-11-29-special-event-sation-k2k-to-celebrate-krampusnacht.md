*The following is a message from special event K2K:*

Special event station [K2K](https://www.qrz.com/db/K2K) will be on the air marking a very old European Alpine region holiday tradition that has gained popularity in recent years in the US: Krampusnacht!

Krampusnacht heralds the arrival in many communities of [The Krampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus), a horned, goat-like figure who rattles chains and menaces those who have been naughty - a dramatic reminder to children to be on their best behavior, especially at Christmas. (Maybe even some hams could clean up their operating behavior too!) The Krampus typically shows up in town in parades or via home visits (where he expects to be fed) and his arrival directly precedes St. Nicholas Day which, this year, is Saturday Dec. 6.

Look for one of the many Krampus calling stations on HF using CW and SSB, or on DMR/YSF/DSTAR - (see our [QRZ.com listing](https://www.qrz.com/db/K2K)) from Dec. 4th at 0000 UTC through to Dec. 5th at 2359 UTC. Each station has its own unique Krampus name, since The Krampus is called many things, depending upon regional custom.

Share your holiday stories and, in due time, you will be rewarded with a beautiful downloadable certificate created by hand just for this event. See our page on [QRZ.com](https://www.qrz.com/db/K2K) for a list of operators and other details.

GRUSS VOM KRAMPUS!
