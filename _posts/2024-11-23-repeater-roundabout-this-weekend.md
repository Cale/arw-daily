The [Repeater Roundabout](https://www.repeaterroundabout.com/) event promotes local repeater use in Washington and Idaho November 23-24.

> The Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of your local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. Itâ€™s also a great way to get started with ham radio contests for folk who are primarily repeater users.
