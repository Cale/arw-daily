The [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://global.jaxa.jp/) (JAXA) recently landed two small probes, LEV-1 and LEV-2, on the surface of the moon. LEV-1 is transmitting Morse Code on 437.41 MHz utilizing the JS1YMG callsign provided by the [JAXA Ham Radio Club](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/home/omotenashi/JHRCweb/jhrc.html) (JHRC). 

Information about [decoding the LEV-1 signal](https://destevez.net/2024/01/trying-to-decode-lev-1/) has been established by Daniel Est√©vez (EA4GPZ / M0HXM).
