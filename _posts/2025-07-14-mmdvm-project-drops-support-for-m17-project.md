[MMDVM](https://mmdvm.com/), a popular software and hardware project that powers many amateur radio hotspots, has [announced](https://groups.io/g/OpenDV/message/2311) the intention to drop the [M17](https://m17project.org/) digital voice and data protocol as a supported mode. First communicated to the OpenDV Groups.io list on July 12th, the project's maintainer cited a number of grievances and rumours behind the decision.

Inclusion of M17 among the supported modes of the MMDVM project has been a major benefit to the current rate of adoption of M17. The first commercial radios supporting M17 shipped in the second half of 2024.

The M17 Project is an open source digital voice and data protocol that is positioned as an alternative to digital modes that require use of proprietary encoders.

MMDVM is an open source project that enables amateur radio hotspots to support multiple digital voice modes including D-STAR, DMR, YSF, P25, NXDN, and POCSAG.
