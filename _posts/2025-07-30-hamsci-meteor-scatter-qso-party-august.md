[HamSCI](https://www.hamsci.org/) will host a [meteor scatter QSO party](https://www.hamsci.org/msqp) in August and again in December. In just a few weeks, the August event will take advantage of the [Perseid meteor shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids) and allow amateur radio operators to conduct QSOs via MSK144 mode. HamSCI expects hundreds of participants on the 6 meter band August 11-12.

In addition to QSOs, HamSCI is requesting audio recordings of decoded pings. This is possible through the [WSJT-X](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html) software suite.

A second party will take place December 12-13 during the [Geminid meteor shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids).
