Each year the US celebrates its independence on July 4th and with that holiday comes the [13 Colonies special event](http://www.13colonies.us/). This year the event takes place between July 1 and July 8. 13 special callsigns will be active, one callsign for each original United States colony. In addition, 3 bonus stations will be active, operating from France, Great Britain, and Philadelphia.

Participants can submit a log sheet and a suggested donation of $5 to receive a special certificate. Working all stations is not required to receive a certificate.

Happy Independence Day!
