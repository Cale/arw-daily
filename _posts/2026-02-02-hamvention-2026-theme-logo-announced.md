[Hamvention](https://hamvention.org/) has [released](https://mailchi.mp/8cf045c8f31d/hamvention-2026-theme-and-logo) the theme and logo for the 2026 Dayton Hamvention show that will take place May 15-17.

This year's theme is "Radio Adventure" referencing exploration of the many avenues ham radio offers.

> Radio has always been about exploration — of ideas, technologies, distances, and possibilities. From the earliest spark-gap pioneers to today’s digital experimenters, satellite operators, contesters, emergency communicators, and outdoor enthusiasts, amateur radio continues to be a gateway to discovery.

Hamvention will take place at the Greene County Fair and Expo Center in Xenia, Ohio.
