[The American Radio Relay League](http://www.arrl.org/) (ARRL) has recently added the Tevel satellites, numbers one through eight, to the list of acceptable satellites in its widely used [Logbook of the World](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotwuser/default) (LoTW) online system. Those who have made contacts using these satellites may now upload those QSOs to LoTW for possible confirmation, if the other station has done likewise.

More information about the Tevel Satellites is [available here](https://amsat-uk.org/2022/01/12/tevel-satellites/) from AMSAT-UK.
