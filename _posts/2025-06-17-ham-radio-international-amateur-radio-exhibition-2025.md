One of the largest amateur radio events in Europe takes place June 27-29 in Friedrichshafen, Germany. The event is [HAM RADIO](https://www.hamradio-friedrichshafen.com/), an International amateur radio exhibition expecting to host more than 11,000 visitors, 400 exhibitors, and 100 lectures. The theme for 2025 is “REMOTE RADIO - CONNECTING THE WORLD”

> One of the advantages of remote operation is that it allows amateur radio operators who are unable to set up a station and, in particular, an antenna at their place of residence, to operate. In the event of a disaster, remote stations can be used as emergency radio stations, replacing destroyed but essential communication structures. In educational settings, they can help to teach amateur radio technology to students, with minimal technical effort required.
