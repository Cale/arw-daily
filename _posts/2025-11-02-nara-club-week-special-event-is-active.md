The [National Amateur Radio Alliance](https://usnara.org/) (NARA) is hosting [Club Week](https://usnara.org/club-week.php), an on-air event encouraging clubs to make contact and exchange QSL cards. Club Week takes place November 1st through November 8th. 

> Unlike a contest, Club Week does not involve earning points or submitting logs to NARA. Instead, it’s a relaxed and engaging event where clubs can operate from a club shack, a member's home, a park, or any public location. Clubs are encouraged to organize additional activities to make the most of this opportunity. Participants should be prepared to send and respond to QSL cards, which provides additional opportunities to engage and teach new hams.

If participating in the event, NARA suggests updating your club's QRZ page, making the event public as a way to engage with the community, and partnering with other local organizations to make additional connections.
