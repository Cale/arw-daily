The [Japanese Amateur Radio League](https://jarl.gr.jp/) (JARL) will be operating special event station 8K3EXPO through October of 2025. The event supports [World Expo 2025](https://www.expo2025.or.jp/) taking place in Osaka, Japan with the purpose of furthering the United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/).

8K3EXPO will be on the air April 13 - October 13 on 1.8 MHz â€“ 10 GHz with an activation planned on 1kW. This event marks the first time a callsign has been established with the 8K prefix.

> By operating an amateur radio station at the Expo site, JARL will promote the event not only across Japan but all over the world through the global amateur radio community. This initiative aims to enhance public awareness and excitement on the Expo, and to foster international exchange. -[IARU](https://www.iaru-r3.org/2025/jarl-is-operating-special-commemorative-station-8k3expoat-osaka-kansai-expo-2025-site/)
