The [Small Satellite Conference](https://smallsat.org/) provides an [extensive series of talks](https://smallsat.org/conference/technical-sessions), speed sessions, and posters that focus on successfully carrying out a small satellite mission. From early wildfire detection using CubeSat images to UHF ground stations for controlling satellites, topics vary wildly. 

The conference takes place August 5-10, 2023 at Utah State University, Logan, Utah, USA.

> During the 37th Annual Small Satellite Conference, we will explore future missions and delve into key technological drivers, operational constructs, and activities that inform and secure the success of small satellite missions at scale.
