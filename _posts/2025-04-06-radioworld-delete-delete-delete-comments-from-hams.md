RadioWorld reports close to 300 comments filed in response to the recent FCC Public Notice, *[In Re: Delete Delete Delete](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-219A1.pdf)* (PDF). Responses related to amateur radio vary from keeping the status quo to eliminating amateur radio licensing completely. 

> A number of the comments received so far have focused on amateur radio and the fear that ham radio could be at risk. The possible loss of spectrum is among the concerns.
