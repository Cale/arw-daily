[Skywarn Youth Net](https://skywarnyouth.net/) is operating a special event under callsign [N0A](https://www.qrz.com/db/N0A). The event aims to educate hams about severe weather awareness. N0A will be active on HF across 80m, 40m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m and will utilize both SSB and FT8 modes. The event runs March 17-31, 2025.

> Each spring, National Weather Service Forecast Offices hold Severe Weather Awareness weeks in their respective regions to educate the public about the dangers of severe weather and the importance of being prepared. Our goal with this special event station is to do the same within the amateur radio community.
