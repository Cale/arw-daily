The 26th annual [Zombie Shuffle](http://www.zianet.com/qrp/ZOMBIE/pg.html) takes place on October 27th. This is a CW QRP event designed to get QRPers on the air and having fun.

> There is no point to the Zombie Shuffle whatsoever except to get on the air and have some goofy fun with fellow Zombies and QRPers.  Even with only 2-3 QSOs, you can earn a fairly large score to brag to your co-workers and QRO buddies.  If you haven't been on the air for awhile, or you are a new CW ham, your fist is “rusty,” or your code speed is slow, this is the “contest” to put a few contacts in the log.  Note that the scoring is based largely on SERENDIPITY rather than operating skill.
