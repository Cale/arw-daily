[ARISS](https://ariss-usa.org/) is [requesting](https://ariss-usa.org/message-to-us-educators-amateur-radio-on-the-international-space-station-contact-opportunity-8/) US educators to submit proposals for upcoming amateur radio contact opportunities with the International Space Station.

> [ARISS] Program is seeking formal and informal education institutions and organizations, individually or working together, to host an Amateur Radio contact with a crew member on board the ISS.  ARISS anticipates that the contact would be held between July 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025. Crew scheduling and ISS orbits will determine the exact contact dates. To maximize these radio contact opportunities, ARISS is looking for organizations that will draw large numbers of participants and integrate the contact into a well-developed education plan.

Proposals are open until November 17th. An ARISS Introductory Webinar session will be held via Zoom on Wednesday, October 16 at 7 PM ET. [Sign up for the Zoom session here](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcpfuqpqzwiGdSZl0IXCPV6XP2OznBnaOIN).
