For the first time, [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/) will have its own booth at [HAM RADIO](https://www.hamradio-friedrichshafen.com/) this year (June 23-25). SOTA is short for Summits on the Air and is an award scheme for radio amateurs that encourages portable operation in mountainous areas.

In addition to lots of general information about mountain radio, there will be many useful hints and answers to questions about radio operation on summits, such as what is the right equipment. At noon on each of the three days of the hamfest, SOTA enthusiasts will meet at the stand (A1-190). The meet-up gives the opportunity to put faces to the friends that up until now you have only met on the radio. Further and current information about the SOTA booth can be found in the [SOTA Reflector](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/sota-booth-at-the-ham-radio-2023-in-friedrichshafen/31350). “We are looking forward to greet many visitors”, said Marcel Müller, DM3FAM, und Roman Brunel, DL3TU, organisers of the stand."
