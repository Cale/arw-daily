The long abandoned New Jersey QRP Club (NJQRP) is experiencing new life thanks to [W2LJ's effort](https://w2lj.blogspot.com/2023/07/resurrection.html) to revive the organization. NJQRP was considered a premier QRP club in the early 2000s, and while the [NJQRP Skeeter Hunt](https://www.qsl.net/w2lj/) has remained a popular event, NJQRP as a club has been inactive since 2016. 

W2LJ has created a new [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/669775754619545) and [Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/NJQRP) email list as a central gathering place. The current plan is to serve local QRPers with possible expansion to Zoom in the future.
