The [Dwingeloo Radio Telescope](https://www.camras.nl/) has [successfully bounced](https://www.camras.nl/en/blog/2025/first-venus-bounce-with-the-dwingeloo-telescope/) a radio signal off Venus and back to Earth. Transmitting at 1299.5 MHz, operators transmitted a 278 second long tone. While Dwingeloo received its own signal, the [Stockert Radio Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockert_Radio_Telescope) located in Germany also received the same signal.

> The data analysis consists of correcting the received data for both the expected Doppler shift and the rate of change of this Doppler shift due to the rotations and relative motions of Earth and Venus. After channelizing the received signal in 1 Hz frequency bins, the echo of the transmitted signal should fall exactly in the predicted bin.

Dwingeloo is planning another Venus bounce in October 2026.
