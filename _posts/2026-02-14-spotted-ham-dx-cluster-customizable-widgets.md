*The following is a press release from SpottedHam.com:* 

Following its successful launch earlier this month, the spotting and alert platform [SpottedHam.com](https://www.spottedham.com/) has released a major feature update driven by community feedback.

In addition to its signature POTA and SOTA real-time email alerts, the platform now integrates a global DX Cluster feed. This allows operators to filter for rare DX alongside portable activations, all within the same lightweight, mobile-first interface. Users can still set custom watchlists for specific callsigns, ensuring they never miss a "need" on the bands.

Perhaps the most significant addition is the new SpottedHam Club Widget. Radio clubs can now generate a custom HTML snippet to embed a live member activity table on their own club websites. This feature aims to help local clubs stay connected by showing at-a-glance what club members are currently on the air.

Developed by Robert Campbell (KM6HBH), SpottedHam continues to focus on a "low-bandwidth, high-speed" philosophy, making it ideal for field use or slow shack connections. The service is free to use and is already running some DX clubs pages.

Operators can explore the new DX filters, set up their first email alert, or generate a widget for their club at: [https://www.spottedham.com](https://www.spottedham.com/).
