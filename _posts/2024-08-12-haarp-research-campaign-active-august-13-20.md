The following is a Notice of Transmission released by the [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/) (HAARP):

The High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program ([HAARP](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/)) will be conducting a research campaign August 13-16 and August 18-20 UTC, with operating times specified in the table below. Operating frequencies will vary, but all HAARP transmissions will be between 2.8 MHz and 10 MHz. Actual transmit days and times are highly variable based on real-time ionospheric and/or geomagnetic conditions. All information is subject to change.

This campaign is being conducted in support of research proposals from the Polar Aeronomy and Radio Science (PARS) Summer School, with over 25 unique experiments taking place. The theme of this year’s program is “Illuminating Space”. The scientific goals of these experiments range from studies on the effects of ionospheric conditions on GPS satellite signals to the generation and propagation of extremely low frequency/very low frequency (ELF/VLF) waves. More information on PARS can be found at [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/pars2024](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/pars2024)

Note that due to the number of experiments and the need to make real-time schedule adjustments based on ionospheric conditions, no frequencies are specified in the table below. The included transmission notice supplement contains information on the frequencies HAARP is authorized to transmit. HAARP transmissions will only occur on our authorized frequencies. There are no specific data collection requests from funded investigators, but reception reports are appreciated and may be submitted to [uaf-gi-haarp@alaska.edu](mailto:uaf-gi-haarp@alaska.edu) or to: HAARP, PO Box 271, Gakona, AK 99586

## General Information for HAARP Radio Enthusiasts:

- The HAARP Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI) transmits in the frequency range 2.750 to 9.600 MHz, with certain frequencies blocked out as specified in the FCC license for call sign WI2XFX.
- The emission bandwidth may be up to 46 kHz; the actual value depends on the frequency, modulation and experiment requirements;
