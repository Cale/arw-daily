The first [HamTV](https://wiki.batc.org.uk/HAMTV_from_the_ISS) transmission from the International Space Station (ISS) since 2018 occurred on October 18, 2025. As part of an ISS contact with the 1st Radford Semele Scout Group in the United Kingdom, HamTV was utilized in addition to FM voice over onboard amateur radio equipment.

[ARISS](https://www.ariss.org/) has uploaded a compilation of [video feeds received](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QK4aT5qNSk) from ground stations in Europe.

The HamTV setup on ISS has been out of commission for repairs since 2018 but was just recently [brought back online](https://daily.hamweekly.com/2025/07/hamtv-international-space-station-iss-installation-success/) in July.
