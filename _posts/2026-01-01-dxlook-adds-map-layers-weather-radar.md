*The following is a message from [DXLook.com](https://www.dxlook.com):*

DXLook has introduced a new map layer system that allows additional data to be displayed directly on top of its propagation maps.

The first available layers include North America Rain Radar and North America Snow Radar, providing real-time weather context alongside HF propagation data. Layers can be enabled or disabled individually to avoid clutter and preserve map readability.

The new layer framework is designed to be extensible, and additional layers are planned. The DXLook team invites users to suggest new layer ideas and reliable public data sources that may benefit the amateur radio community.

This update also brings back user-requested controls:   
- Hide / Show Arcs, to toggle propagation paths
- Hide / Show Labels, to control callsign and time labels

Several UI and cosmetic improvements were also made to the main menu, improving usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

DXLook is available at [https://www.dxlook.com](https://www.dxlook.com)
