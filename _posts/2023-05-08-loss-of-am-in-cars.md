The National Alliance of State Broadcasters Association (NASBA) is reporting insights it discovered after polling AM stations about the removal of over-the-air AM in new cars.

The most telling survey result, according to NASBA, is that 8 in 10 of the radio stations responding listed their level of concern as 10 out of 10 when it comes to AM being eliminated in the car. 

Eight automakers have decided to drop AM radio from some of their models, mostly EVs, and have cited interference with AM radio reception caused by electric motors as the reason.
