*The following is a message from the Radio Club de l’Agglomération Dunkerquoise:*

The [Radio Club de l’Agglomération Dunkerquoise - F8KGS](https://www.facebook.com/groups/f8kgs.org/) - is proud to announce the activation of a special event amateur radio station: [TM5VDL](https://www.qrz.com/db/TM5VDL), on the occasion of the “[Voile des Légendes Dunkerque 2025](https://voilesdelegende.fr/)” maritime festival.

Held every few years in the historic port city of [Dunkerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk), northern France, Les Voiles de Légende is a celebrated gathering of classic and legendary sailing ships from across Europe. The city comes alive with nautical pride, music, maritime culture—and in 2025, with radio waves!

This special callsign [TM5VDL](https://www.qrz.com/db/TM5VDL) will be active from July 5th to 19th, operated by members of F8KGS Radio Club. Operators will be mainly active on HF, sharing the spirit of this majestic event with amateurs worldwide.

A special QSL card will be sent via bureau.

Join us on the air and help us celebrate the union of maritime heritage and amateur radio!
