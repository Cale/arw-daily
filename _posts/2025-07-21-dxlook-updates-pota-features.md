*The following is a press release from [DXLook](https://dxlook.com):*

DXLook, the all-in-one platform for live ham radio reception data, has introduced a significant update to its Parks On The Air (POTA) view, aimed at enhancing usability and improving how operators track current activations.

The new release introduces a Time Filter, new visual toggles, and more precise display of activator and spotter locations ‚Äî all designed to help users get a cleaner, real-time picture of POTA activity.

‚è±Ô∏è **Time-Based Filtering**   
Users can now filter activations by how recent the spot is, selecting from:

15 minutes   
30 minutes   
1 hour   
2 hours   
6 hours

This feature allows for immediate visibility into the most current activity ‚Äî especially helpful during rapid band openings or short VHF events.

üéØ **New Map Controls: Arcs and Time Labels**

Two new toggle buttons give users direct control over the visual clutter on the map:

- Hide/Show Arcs: Connection lines between activator and spotters can now be toggled on or off.
- Hide/Show Time: The time-ago labels displayed at the end of each arc can be turned off for a cleaner view.

üó∫Ô∏è **Enhanced Grid Display**

Each arc now ends with a visual indicator of the 6-character Maidenhead grid for the spotter‚Äôs location. These grid boxes are color-coded by band and include an 80% transparent fill to improve legibility. Hovering over the grid displays the full tooltip with callsign, frequency, mode, comments, and timestamp.

üéõÔ∏è **Full Filter Stack**

As before, the POTA view continues to support filtering by:   
Callsign   
4- or 6-character Grid   
Park Reference   
Band   
Mode

All filters work together to create a powerful real-time view tailored to user needs.

üöß **Still in Active Development**

DXLook‚Äôs creator, Rodrigo Vazquez (AK6FP), noted that the platform remains in daily development. ‚ÄúThe new POTA features were driven by real user feedback. It‚Äôs a living project ‚Äî and we‚Äôre just getting started.‚Äù
