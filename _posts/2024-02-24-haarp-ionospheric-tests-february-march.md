> The [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/) (HAARP) will be conducting a research campaign February 28-March 3 UTC, with operating times specified in the table below. Operating frequencies will vary, but all HAARP transmissions will be between 2.8 MHz and 10 MHz. Actual transmit days and times are highly variable based on real-time ionospheric and/or geomagnetic conditions. All information is subject to change.

> These experiments will help lead to a greater understanding of the production and enhancement of ELF/VLF waves, as well as lay groundwork for future studies of satellite interactions with space plasma. For more information on ELF/VLF wave generation with HAARP, see the online HAARP FAQ at [https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/faq](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/faq).
