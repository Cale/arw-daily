On Monday, the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program ([HAARP](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/)) released a [statement](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/news/solar-storm-not-haarp-creates-intense-auroral-display) reiterating that the sun, not HAARP was responsible for the recent aurora display this past weekend.

>“We have been responding to many inquiries from the media and the public,” Matthews said. “The HAARP scientific experiments were in no way linked to the solar storm or high auroral activity seen around the globe.”    
The May HAARP campaign was scheduled about a month and a half before the geomagnetic storm. The timing was purely coincidental; geomagnetic storms are unpredictable, with lead times before a solar event is detected from Earth measured in minutes, not months.
