[Fram2](http://f2.com/) and SpaceX are planning an [SSTV event](http://f2.com/ham/) to be transmitted from a Dragon spacecraft carrying 4 astronauts over the course of a 3-5 day polar orbit. This mission is unique in that spacecraft orbits rarely expose astronauts to polar regions of the planet. 

The SSTV event is an experimental radio competition aimed at high school and university students. Images of geographical locations will be transmitted out of order with students expected to receive, solve the puzzle, and identify the geographic location.

No exact date has been published on the Fram2 website, but the mission is expected to launch this spring.
