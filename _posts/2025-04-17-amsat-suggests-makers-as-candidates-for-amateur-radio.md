In a recent [news bulletin](https://www.amsat.org/ans-103-amsat-news-service-bulletins/), [AMSAT](https://www.amsat.org/) encouraged amateur radio clubs to focus on [Makers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) as a recruiting source for new members. AMSAT pointed to Makers interested in space technology as prime candidates due to the overlap in interests with small board computers (SBCs), 3D printing for antenna purposes, and custom HT firmware.

> You may recall that the 3-D printed components and Raspberry Pi (RPi) SBCs have been key components of many recent AMSAT projects. RPi. Is often the SBC of choice, especially in severely volume-restricted cubesats.

AMSAT suggested amateur radio clubs invest in equipment such as 3D printers and SBC projects to help recruit new members. Future articles related to attracting Makers to the amateur radio space will be forthcoming from AMSAT in later issues of their weekly news bulletin.
