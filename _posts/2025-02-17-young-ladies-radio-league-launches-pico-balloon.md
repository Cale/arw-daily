The [Young Ladies Radio League](https://ylrl.net/) (YLRL) launched a [Pico Balloon](https://www.picoballoons.net/) on Saturday February 15th from Arizona, US. The balloon is currently traversing the Atlantic ocean at around 44,000 feet.

> Yesterday morning in the dark at 1210utc Vicki N6KLS president of YLRL, Tom N6BT and myself [K7CNT] launched the YLRL K4LMB Pico Balloon from Kingman, Arizona. Was very calm air and the balloon went straight up and within 3 hours it was at 43,000ft heading straight for Nogales AZ, it dipped into Mexico and then turned back to the NE and crossed the Rio Grande River and ended the day south of Midland Texas. It traveled a whopping 1,800 miles overnight and is out over the Atlantic Ocean this morning at 44,000ft. This balloon and tracker was generously donated by Bob Goulden KJ7VBX. Thank you Bob, the YLRL group members are very excited about this flight and are hoping for a great flight. It's at a great altitude so far and traveling at 94 mph.
