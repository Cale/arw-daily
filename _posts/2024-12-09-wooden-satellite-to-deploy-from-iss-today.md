[LingoSat](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/crez9gw255po), a CubeSat constructed mainly of wood, will [launch from the ISS today](https://www.amsat.org/ans-343-amsat-news-service-weekly-bulletins/). Initial opportunities for data acquisition and amateur radio packet activities will take place on December 10th. 

Deployment time from the ISS is scheduled for December 9, 2024, 20:30 JST/11:30 UTC +-90 minutes. A CW beacon will be present on 435.82 MHz with first passes for Japan at 06:30 JST on December 10th and North America around 12:20 UTC if the deployment process occurs early.

Initial tracking of LingoSat can be accomplished by tracking the ISS as the wooden satellite will follow the same orbit as ISS until eventually flying ahead of the ISS.
