The winter edition of [Support Your Parks Weekend](https://docs.pota.app/docs/events.html) takes place January 18th and 19th. This is an official [Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/) (POTA) event that encourages operators to make their way to a park and enjoy the day.  

Support Your Parks Weekend takes place 4 times per year, winter, spring, summer, and autumn.

> Getting started with POTA can happen via one of two paths — as an “activator” who heads out into the parks or as a “hunter” who is trying to contact someone in a park. The easiest way to participate in POTA is as a hunter.
