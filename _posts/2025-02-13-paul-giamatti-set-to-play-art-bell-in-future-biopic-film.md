[Screen Rant reports](https://screenrant.com/paul-giamatti-radio-silence-dj-art-bell-movie-casting/) of an upcoming film set to portray the late Art Bell and his radio show *Coast to Coast AM*. Paul Giamatti is said to be starring in the lead role.

> With Giamatti, a two-time Oscar-nominated actor attached to star, the Art Bell biopic has received a big boost in terms of its prestige. The late paranormal DJ hosted the five-hour radio show, Coast to Coast, which took unscreened calls from guests recounting allegedly firsthand tales of alien encounters, reincarnation, time travel, and other phenomena reminiscent of The X-Files. Bell even claimed to have had his own UFO encounter. At the peak of its popularity during the 1990s, Coast to Coast drew an audience of roughly 10 million listeners.

Amazon and Warner Bros. are said to be bidding on the project. 

In addition to working as a radio host, [Art Bell was an Amateur Radio operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Bell#Amateur_radio) holding a license in the US (W6OBB) and Philippines (4F1AB). He was originally licensed at age 13, eventually earning an Extra Class license in the US.
