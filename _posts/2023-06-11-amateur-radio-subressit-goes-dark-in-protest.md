The Amateur Radio focused Reddit community has joined [thousands of other communities on Reddit](https://reddark.untone.uk/) in "going dark" to protest Reddit's upcoming changes to its API. Protestors believe the API changes will hurt community moderation as 3rd party apps are essentially phased off the platform. 

Reddit recently announced it will soon begin charging for access to its API, which currently powers 3rd party apps. A thorough write-up of the broader issue is [available from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/10/23756476/reddit-protest-api-changes-apollo-third-party-apps).

[r/amateurradio](https://old.reddit.com/r/amateurradio) and its 100,000+ users join thousands of other subreddits in going private to limit access to the Reddit platform.
