If you are interested in doing a 1 hour time slot or a 2 hour time slot, please by all means contact W2JLD or GW8SZL via email and leave your info and what time you’d would like to do and for how long. We could never do this special event if not for the volunteers whom take time out of their day to do this event.

### World Amateur Radio Day 2024

> This year [IARU](https://www.iaru.org/) is very pleased to announce the theme of: "A Century of Connections: Celebrating 100 years of Amateur Radio Innovation, Community, and Advocacy."
>
> IARU celebrates its centenary in 2025. Since its founding in Paris, France, IARU has worked tirelessly to promote innovation in amateur radio and to encourage the growth of the service in communities throughout the world. IARU has represented the Amateur Services at international and regional regulatory bodies by relying on our volunteers who come from many countries and communities.

While 2024 will mark our 9th anniversary of this event, it also shows how much we as a group of like minded individuals who have made this hobby what it is today.

In 2015, I came up with an idea to recognize World Amateur Radio Day that no one else came up with while I was a net controller on another EchoLink conference and after leaving that conference it was moved to another EchoLink conference where it was welcomed with open arms and since 2015 the event has grown 10 fold. Now I have my own EchoLink conference, the [ROC-HAM](https://www.roc-ham.net/). The special event now has a permanent home, where I will continue doing what I started in 2015.
    
#### World Amateur Radio Day

> Every April 18, radio amateurs worldwide take to the airwaves in celebration of World Amateur Radio Day. It was on this day in 1925 that the International Amateur Radio Union was formed in Paris. April 18th 2024 marks the 99th anniversary of the formation of the IARU in Paris.
>
> Amateur Radio experimenters were the first to discover that the short wave spectrum — far from being a wasteland — could support worldwide propagation. In the rush to use these shorter wavelengths, Amateur Radio was "in grave danger of being pushed aside," the IARU’s history has noted. Amateur Radio pioneers met in Paris in 1925 and created the IARU to support Amateur Radio worldwide.
