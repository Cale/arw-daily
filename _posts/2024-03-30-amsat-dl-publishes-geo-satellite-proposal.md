In response to the [IARU](https://www.iaru.org/) and [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) [request for feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5TYe4uBN6U) from the amateur radio community regarding a geostationary satellite, AMSAT-DL has published an extensive proposal for a [Geostationary Microwave Amateur Radio Payload](https://amsat-dl.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AMSAT-DL_Proposal-Geo-Payload_final.pdf) (PDF).

The 31 slide proposal explores positioning that would include eastern European countries and large portions of eastern North America with the western limit including Ontario and points east. 

Additional considerations include hosted vs. non-hosted payloads, a Micro GEO platform, and upcoming European based launch systems as a delivery method to orbit. 

The proposal goes into great detail on feasible frequency bands, transponders, and even draft frequency plans.
