The 5th annual [Amateur Radio Software Award](https://arsaward.com/) was recently granted to Jakob Ketterl (DD5JFK) and Marat Fayzullin (KC1TXE) for their contributions to [OpenWebRX](https://www.openwebrx.de/) and [OpenWebRX+](https://fms.komkon.org/OWRX/), respectively. Both projects allow software defined radio (SDR) receivers to be accessible through a web browser with full waterfall display and tuning controls. OpenWebRX+ includes support for noise reduction and decoding of additional digital modes.

The Amateur Radio Software Award is designed to recognize projects that enhance amateur radio through software innovation that is open source and unique.
