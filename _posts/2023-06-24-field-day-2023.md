It's been a slow news week in the world of amateur radio, perhaps because everyone is busy prepping for the biggest ham radio event of the year, [Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day)!

Even if you're not participating in the event this year, I highly encourage you to take some time, find a local event, and stop by for a few minutes to see what your local groups are up to. You'd be surprised how involved and public facing many Field Day events can be. (The prospect of a free lunch isn't bad, either.)

The ARRL has a great [Field Day locator map](http://www.arrl.org/field-day-locator) that highlights many local Field Day events. Get out and check out what's new. You might be inspired to explore a completely different aspect of the hobby from what you're used to.
