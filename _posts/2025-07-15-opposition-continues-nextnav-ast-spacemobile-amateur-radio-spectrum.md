AST SpaceMobile and NextNav continue to receive pushback from groups opposing the potential encroachment of amateur radio spectrum by these companies. 

Communications Daily [reports](https://communicationsdaily.com/article/view?search_id=36649&id=2403431) that Connected Devices for America Coalition held a meeting with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voicing their [concerns](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1071448718592/1) over NextNav's [proposed restructuring](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-776A1.pdf) of the 900 MHz band. The coalition described the band as a "workhorse" for unlicensed innovation.

Separately, an amateur radio operator based in Germany has [filed a petition](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/filing/10714174724585) with the FCC to oppose AST SpaceMobile's request to utilize portions of the 70 cm band allocated to amateur radio use. 

> Without a clear showing that AST does not cause harmful interference under ยง4.4, let alone the incapability to cause interference under ยง4.2, the application should be denied.

The comment period for AST SpaceMobile's [request](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-532A1.pdf) to utilize amateur spectrum is open through July 21st.
