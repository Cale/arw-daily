*A note from Narwhal Amateur Radio Society:*

The [Narwhal Amateur Radio Society](https://nars.narwhal.be/) is doing a [special event station](https://nars.narwhal.be/polio/) from April 5th through April 19th to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the US approval of the Polio vaccine. This vaccine, and many others, are responsible for saving at least 154 million lives over the last 50 years, and weâ€™d like to celebrate that!
