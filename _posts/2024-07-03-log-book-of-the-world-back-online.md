[Log Book of The World](https://lotw.arrl.org/) (LoTW) has returned to service after a lengthy outage. [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/) is asking users to refrain from uploading large amounts of QSOs for a few weeks in order to minimize the potential backlog of uploads. In addition, users are asked to remove duplicates from their logs to help further reduce server load. Planned downtime is expected through the rest of the year to further enhance the service. Users can contact [LoTW-help@arrl.org](mailto:oTW-help@arrl.org) for assistance.
